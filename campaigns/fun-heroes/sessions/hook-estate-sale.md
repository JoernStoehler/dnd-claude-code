# The Wizard's Estate Sale

**Status:** Hook developed, not yet run
**Estimated Runtime:** 3-4 hours
**Location:** Weathervane Manor (see `lore/locations/weathervane-manor.md`)

## The Situation

The late Aldric Weathervane's possessions are being auctioned to pay his debts. The Merchant Consortium is running the sale, various factions want specific items, and everything in the house is "slightly" magical in ways that may cause problems.

The players are there for a reason (their own, or hired by someone else). But so is everyone else, and not everyone plans to bid fairly.

**If players do nothing:** The auction happens, items disperse, some buyers regret their purchases. But a clean auction is boring—something will go wrong.

## Why Players Are There

Pick or let players choose:

1. **Hired to acquire something:** Clerk Fenwick (Guild) or someone else wants a specific item. Budget is limited.
2. **Personal interest:** An invitation arrived—maybe a dead relative knew Aldric, or they've heard rumors about what's inside
3. **Security:** The Consortium hired them to keep order. Ha.
4. **Curiosity:** An estate sale for a wizard? What could go wrong?

## The Auction Setup

**Morning:** Viewing period. Prospective buyers can tour the manor, examine items, take notes. The house is... active.

**Afternoon:** Auction begins. Items are sold in lots. Bidding happens. Complications arise.

**Evening:** Aftermath. Some buyers got more than they bargained for.

## Key Factions at the Auction

### The Merchant Consortium
Running the sale to recoup debts Aldric owed. **Auctioneer Griswold** is efficient, humorless, and wants this over with. They don't care who buys what, just that money changes hands.

### The College of Wizardry
**Proctor Velmira** is here for Aldric's research notes and workshop equipment. Has a budget, won't go over it, will be very annoyed if outbid. Might hire players to "ensure" certain lots go her way.

### The Weathervane Family
**Cousin Morgana** believes she should inherit everything. Has lawyers, has grudges, has a plan to contest the sale. Might try to delay or sabotage the auction.

### The Unknown Collector
Someone bidding through proxies on seemingly random items. Actually looking for a specific thing—maybe the crystal containing Aldric, maybe the key to the Locked Room, maybe something else.

### Local Bargain Hunters
Regular Millhaven folk hoping to get household goods cheap. Mostly comic relief, but might accidentally acquire something problematic.

## Notable Auction Lots

| Lot | Contents | Who Wants It | The Catch |
|-----|----------|--------------|-----------|
| 1-5 | Household goods | Locals | Some items are "improved" (self-making beds, etc.) |
| 6 | The portraits | Morgana (family heirlooms) | The portraits talk and have opinions about buyers |
| 7 | Library contents | College (research) | Books sorted by Aldric's incomprehensible system |
| 8 | Workshop equipment | College (priority) | Half-finished experiments, unstable |
| 9 | Wine cellar contents | Various | Some bottles are... not wine |
| 10 | "Miscellaneous curiosities" | Unknown Collector | Includes things no one can identify |
| 11 | The armchair | No one (creepy) | Might be Aldric's transformed body |
| 12 | The manor itself | Morgana vs ??? | If the estate fails to sell, new complications |

## What Goes Wrong

Pick 2-3:

### Something Activates
An item being demonstrated does something unexpected. Transmutation accidents, escaped "experiments," or the house itself objects to being sold.

### The Sabotage
Morgana (or another faction) tries to disrupt the auction. Fire alarm, fake ghosts, legal injunction delivered at a dramatic moment.

### The Discovery
Someone finds something that wasn't on the manifest. A hidden room, a secret document, or the crystal containing Aldric's consciousness.

### The Bidding War
Two factions want the same lot badly. Bidding escalates beyond reason. Losing party gets desperate.

### The Theft Attempt
Someone tries to steal an item rather than buy it. Could be players, could be NPCs, could be the Unknown Collector's backup plan.

### Aldric Intervenes
If his consciousness is present (crystal, ghost, or otherwise), he might have opinions about who gets his stuff.

## Possible Outcomes

**Players acquire something valuable:**
- Sets up future hooks (they now own a problem)
- The item might be more trouble than expected
- They've made enemies of whoever they outbid

**Players acquire the estate itself:**
- Leads directly to "The Inheritance" hook
- The Ledger of Debts comes with it
- Congratulations, they own a cursed house

**Players acquire the crystal (Aldric):**
- Leads to "The Sentient Cargo" hook
- They now have a wizard who owes a lot of debts
- Someone will come looking for him

**Players expose something:**
- The fake death, Morgana's schemes, or the Unknown Collector's identity
- Changes the power dynamics for future hooks

**Players just survive:**
- They've seen the estate, met the factions, witnessed the chaos
- Sets up future involvement

## NPCs

### Auctioneer Griswold
- **Appearance:** Thin, precise, ink-stained fingers, never smiles
- **Want:** Complete the sale, go home
- **Fear:** Complications that reduce the sale value
- **Quirk:** Describes cursed items with the same tone as furniture

### Proctor Velmira (College)
- **Appearance:** Academic robes, severe bun, takes constant notes
- **Want:** Aldric's research at a reasonable price
- **Fear:** Knowledge falling into "unqualified hands"
- **Quirk:** Mutters assessments of everyone's intelligence

### Cousin Morgana (Weathervane Family)
- **Appearance:** Well-dressed, pinched expression, family resemblance to portraits
- **Want:** Everything, by right of blood
- **Fear:** Losing what she sees as her inheritance
- **Quirk:** References "the family" as if it were a major institution

### The Unknown Collector's Proxy
- **Appearance:** Nondescript, forgettable, bids without expression
- **Want:** Specific items on a list they won't show
- **Fear:** Being identified
- **Quirk:** Never speaks except to bid; communicates via notes

## The "Oh Shit" Moment

If energy flags: The Locked Room door... opens. Just a crack. Something whispers from inside. The auction pauses. Everyone looks at the door. What now?

## Tone Notes

- The auction should feel chaotic but manageable—then get worse
- Items should be comedically inconvenient rather than grimdark cursed
- Every faction has understandable goals; no one's purely evil
- The estate itself is a character—it reacts to events
