# The Inheritance

**Status:** Hook developed, not yet run
**Estimated Runtime:** 3-4 hours
**Location:** Weathervane Manor (see `lore/locations/weathervane-manor.md`)

## The Situation

The players suddenly own Weathervane Manor. Doesn't matter how—inheritance, winning a bet, paperwork snafu, or waking up with the deed in their pocket. The estate is theirs.

The problem: they have about 24 hours before **The Ledger of Debts** activates for the new owner. Once it does, Erasmus's twenty-year-old debts—including the ones to *entities*—become theirs.

This is a hot-potato comedy. The goal isn't to keep the house. The goal is to find someone else to dump it on before the deadline.

**If players do nothing:** The debts become theirs. Creditors arrive. Very bad things follow.

## The Hook

However they acquired it, players learn two things fast:

1. **The Ledger of Debts:** A magical book in the study that records all obligations tied to the estate. It's currently "dormant" for new owners—a grace period. At midnight, it activates.

2. **The Grace Period:** Previous owners discovered you have about a day after acquiring the deed before the Ledger recognizes you. If you transfer ownership before then, the debts stay with the property, not with you.

The race is on.

## The Ledger of Debts

When they find it (and they should find it fast):

**Mundane debts (manageable):**
- 500gp to the Merchant Consortium
- Various small amounts to local businesses
- Library fines to the College of Wizardry

**Unusual debts (concerning):**
- "One favor, owed to the Lord of Crossroads"
- "Completion of the Great Work, or equivalent service"
- "Safe passage for [illegible] until the door opens"

**The fine print:** These debts have accumulated interest. Not monetary interest—*other* kinds.

## The Problem

They can't just throw the deed away. The manor's enchantments require a willing transfer to a person who accepts ownership. That means:

1. Finding someone willing to take it
2. Convincing them to accept (knowing or unknowing)
3. Completing the transfer before midnight

## Potential "Heirs"

The party must choose who gets stuck with the estate. Each option has different requirements and consequences.

### Cousin Morgana Weathervane
**The Claim:** She's been trying to get the estate for years. She'll take it.

- **Convince her:** Easy. She wants it. Just sign.
- **The catch:** She knows about the debts. She has a plan. Her plan probably isn't good for anyone else.
- **Consequence:** Morgana becomes a recurring problem. She might succeed where others failed—and what she does with that success won't be pleasant.

### Clerk Fenwick
**The Claim:** He could file it as "abandoned property recovered by the Adventurer's Guild."

- **Convince him:** Difficult. He knows it's irregular. Appeals to bureaucratic pride ("think of the filing fees"), bribery, or finding a legal loophole might work.
- **The catch:** He has no idea what he's getting into.
- **Consequence:** Fenwick becomes entangled in manor problems. He might ask for help later. Players might feel guilty.

### A Young Adventurer
**The Claim:** "I'll take on any challenge!" Some fresh-faced hero who thinks they can handle a haunted manor.

- **Convince them:** Easy. They're eager. Just paint it as an opportunity.
- **The catch:** They're going to die or flee within the week.
- **Consequence:** Players definitely feel guilty if they learn what happened. The manor becomes someone else's problem—until the next adventurer shows up at the estate sale.

### The Merchant Consortium
**The Claim:** They'd take it, demolish it, sell the land. Business.

- **Convince them:** Moderate. They know it's trouble. Might need to sweeten the deal or hide the worst debts.
- **The catch:** They'll destroy everything—including secrets, artifacts, and the Locked Room.
- **Consequence:** The manor's mysteries are lost forever. Whatever's in the Locked Room either escapes or is buried. Either way, it won't stay quiet.

### Elder Cornelius Marsh
**The Claim:** "Brackenvale shall expand its holdings!" He'll see it as prestige.

- **Convince him:** Moderate. Appeal to his ego. "The village that owns Weathervane Manor—imagine the history books!"
- **The catch:** He's completely out of his depth. The village can't handle manor-level problems.
- **Consequence:** Brackenvale gets entangled. The elder is in over his head. Players might need to rescue him later.

### The College of Wizardry
**The Claim:** "For research purposes." They've wanted it for decades.

- **Convince them:** Easy if you contact the right people. They'll accept enthusiastically.
- **The catch:** They will absolutely open the Locked Room.
- **Consequence:** Whatever Erasmus was hiding gets studied. Depending on what it is, this could be very good or very bad.

### Leave It to No One (The Nuclear Option)
**The Claim:** Destroy the deed, burn the manor, deny ownership.

- **Convince:** No one to convince, just commitment.
- **The catch:** The Ledger doesn't care. If no one else owns it by midnight, the last holder is still responsible.
- **Consequence:** Only works if combined with destroying the Ledger itself—which requires entering the manor, finding the Ledger, and dealing with whatever protects it.

## Session Structure

### Act 1: Discovery (30 min)
- Players learn they own the manor
- Quick tour reveals the quirks (self-making beds, speaking portraits, the Wandering Door)
- They find the Ledger
- Someone explains the deadline (Cressida Mopp, a portrait, or a letter from a previous owner)

### Act 2: The Search (90 min)
- Players identify potential heirs
- Complications arise (someone they approach has conditions, someone else wants the estate, time pressure)
- They learn more about the debts (each potential heir might reveal different information)

**Complications:**
- Cousin Morgana tries to delay them (she wants the deadline to pass)
- The Merchant Consortium wants to negotiate rather than accept
- The College wants to inspect first (takes time they don't have)
- Someone (the creditors?) notices activity at the manor

### Act 3: The Transfer (45 min)
- Players make their choice
- The transfer has requirements (legal documents, physical presence, magical ritual, or just a handshake depending on their approach)
- Something goes wrong or gets complicated (optional)
- Midnight approaches

### Resolution
- Did they make the deadline?
- Who owns the manor now?
- What are the immediate consequences?
- What threads remain?

## Complications

Pick 2-3:

### The Other Claimant
Someone else shows up with a deed. Morgana, an unknown relative, or a faction with forged documents. Now there's a race.

### The Curious Portrait
One of Lady Ashworth's speaking portraits knows something about the debts. It'll trade information for... something. Time spent negotiating is time not finding an heir.

### The Premature Activation
The Ledger stirs earlier than expected. A minor debt comes due—something small but threatening, as a preview of midnight.

### The Moral Test
The easiest heir option is also the worst (the naive adventurer who'll die). Do players take the easy path?

### The Locked Room Speaks
Something inside notices the new ownership. It makes contact. It has an offer. Listening takes time.

## The Midnight Deadline

If players fail to transfer ownership:

**Immediate:** The Ledger activates. Their names appear. They feel it—a weight, a connection.

**Short-term:** The mundane creditors arrive within days.

**Long-term:** The unusual debts stir. The Lord of Crossroads sends a messenger. The Great Work demands attention.

This isn't a game over—it's a complication. They can still try to transfer ownership, but now they're doing it while creditors are actively pursuing them.

## What Players Keep

Even after dumping the property:

- Knowledge of the manor's layout and secrets (useful for the Heist if they ever need to return)
- Relationships with whoever they gave it to (good or bad)
- Anything they grabbed during the tour
- Guilt or satisfaction, depending on their choice

## Tone Notes

- This is a comedy of frantic property transfer
- The house should be entertainingly weird, not just threatening
- The choice of heir matters—let players weigh the options
- "Winning" is successfully dumping the property; the quality of win depends on who they choose
- The consequences of their choice can echo into other hooks
