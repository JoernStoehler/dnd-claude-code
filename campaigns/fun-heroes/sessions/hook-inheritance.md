# The Inheritance

**Status:** Hook developed, not yet run
**Estimated Runtime:** 3-4 hours
**Location:** Weathervane Manor (see `lore/locations/weathervane-manor.md`)
**Prerequisite:** Works best after "The Estate Sale" but can stand alone

## The Situation

The players now own Weathervane Manor. Whether they bought it, inherited it, won it in a bet, or woke up with the deed in their pocket, the estate is theirs.

The problem: the estate comes with obligations. **The Ledger of Debts** records everything Aldric owed—and now those debts belong to them. Some are mundane (money to the Consortium). Some are not (favors owed to entities unknown).

This is a "keeping house" horror comedy. They'll try to make the manor work, discover why no one keeps it for long, and ultimately have to give it up.

**If players do nothing:** The debts come due. Creditors arrive. Things escalate.

## Opening: Welcome Home

The players take possession. The house acknowledges them (doors unlock, the speaking portraits greet them, beds make themselves threateningly).

**Initial discoveries:**
- The house is functional but weird (all the quirks from the location doc)
- Cressida Mopp (former housekeeper) can be hired to explain things—for a price
- The Ledger of Debts is in the study, waiting

## The Ledger of Debts

A magical book that records all obligations connected to the estate. It updates in real-time.

**Mundane debts (annoying but manageable):**
- 500gp to the Merchant Consortium (back taxes)
- 200gp to a carpenter (repairs never paid for)
- 80gp to the College of Wizardry (library fines)

**Unusual debts (concerning):**
- "One favor, owed to the Lord of Crossroads" - no details
- "The completion of the Great Work" - no explanation
- "Safe passage for [illegible] until the door opens" - what door?

**The catch:** The debts transfer with ownership. To stop owing, you must either pay... or stop owning.

## The Escalation

Structure the session as mounting pressure:

### Phase 1: Small Problems
- The mundane creditors come calling
- The house's quirks cause inconveniences
- Neighbors are wary of new owners

### Phase 2: Bigger Problems
- A faction from the estate sale wants something (didn't get it at auction)
- One of the unusual debts stirs—a messenger arrives
- Something in the house activates that shouldn't

### Phase 3: The Crisis
- The "Lord of Crossroads" (or equivalent) sends a representative
- The debt is called in: they want something the players don't want to give
- A choice must be made

## The Factions Return

### Cousin Morgana
Still believes the estate is rightfully hers. Might offer to "take it off their hands" (at a terrible price), or might try to make ownership so unpleasant they leave.

### The College of Wizardry
Proctor Velmira wants access to the workshop. Might negotiate, might make demands, might try to buy the estate.

### The Unknown Collector
Revealed: they want access to the Locked Room. Who they are depends on what the DM wants:
- A fey lord (Aldric's creditor)
- A rival wizard (seeking forbidden knowledge)
- An heir of someone Aldric wronged

### Aldric (If Involved)
If players have the crystal or he's manifesting, he might:
- Try to reclaim his home
- Offer to help (his help is... complicated)
- Reveal what's actually in the Locked Room

## The Locked Room

Whatever's in there, it's central to why no one keeps the estate.

**Options:**
- A portal to somewhere else (debts owed across planar boundaries)
- A trapped entity (Aldric promised to keep it contained)
- Aldric's greatest/worst creation (The Great Work?)
- The source of the estate's magic (and the source of its problems)

**Discovery:** Players can find the key (it's in the room with the thing that requires the key—classic Aldric), or break in, or negotiate with whatever's inside.

## How Players Lose the House

The hook is designed to end with loss—but not *unfair* loss. Options:

### Trade It Away
The creditor accepts the estate itself as payment. Players walk away clean but with nothing.

### Sacrifice It
To stop something bad (the Locked Room entity, a spreading curse), the estate must be destroyed or sealed.

### Outmaneuvered
Cousin Morgana or another faction produces a better legal claim. Players can fight it (expensive, time-consuming) or accept the loss.

### Willing Departure
Players realize the estate is more trouble than it's worth and *choose* to leave. They negotiate the best exit they can.

### It Wasn't Real
The "inheritance" was a test, a trick, or a dream. They wake up with knowledge but not ownership.

## What Players Keep

Even after losing the house, they might retain:

- Knowledge of the estate's secrets (useful for the Heist)
- Relationships with factions (positive or negative)
- A portable item they smuggled out
- A debt still owed (complicating future)
- Aldric himself (if he's in crystal form)

## NPCs

### The Creditor's Representative
(Depends on who the Lord of Crossroads is)
- **Appearance:** Unnerving, too polite, something slightly wrong
- **Want:** What they're owed, nothing more
- **Fear:** Nothing; they hold all the cards
- **Quirk:** Extremely specific about contract terms

### Cressida Mopp (Former Housekeeper)
- **Appearance:** Elderly, practical, permanent expression of "I warned you"
- **Want:** Money to explain things; also, for people to stop dying here
- **Fear:** Being drawn back into the manor's problems
- **Quirk:** Refers to objects by affectionate nicknames, then describes how they maimed someone

## The "Oh Shit" Moment

If energy flags: The Locked Room opens. Whatever's inside acknowledges the new owners. It's grateful to be noticed. It has expectations.

## Tone Notes

- This is a comedy of ownership—they got what they wanted and now they're stuck with it
- The house should feel alive and opinionated, not just haunted
- The loss should feel earned, not arbitrary—player choices determine *how* they lose it
- Losing can still be winning if they get something valuable out
