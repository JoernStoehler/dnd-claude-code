# The Wrongly Accused

**Status:** Hook developed, not yet run
**Estimated Runtime:** 3-4 hours

## The Situation

Someone broke into the Merchant Consortium's vault in Millhaven and stole a valuable shipment of gems. The guards arrested **Tomas Brightwell**, a journeyman locksmith, because he had means (lockpicking skills), motive (debts), and was seen near the vault that night.

The twist: the authorities are actually competent. Captain Verra of the town guard and Mayor Hollis both suspect Tomas is being framed, but they can't prove it. The Merchant Consortium is demanding someone hang for this. The Captain quietly approaches adventurers because she needs investigators without political ties.

Everyone has a different theory about who really did it. Everyone is wrong in an interesting way.

## The Real Culprit

**Aldric Crane**, a mid-level Consortium clerk, orchestrated the theft to cover embezzlement. He's been skimming for years and was about to be caught in an upcoming audit. He hired outside thieves to steal the gems (which he'd already replaced with fakes months ago), framed Tomas, and plans to disappear once the heat dies down.

Aldric is competent, panicking, and not a mastermind—he's an accountant who made one bad decision and keeps making it worse.

## The Competing Theories

Everyone has a suspect. They're all wrong, but investigating each lead reveals useful information.

### The Guard's Theory (Captain Verra)
**Suspect:** A rival merchant guild from the coast.
**Logic:** They'd benefit from embarrassing the Consortium. Professional job.
**What investigation reveals:** No coastal guild involvement, BUT you find evidence of outside thieves (not local criminals).

### The Mayor's Theory (Mayor Hollis)
**Suspect:** Internal Consortium corruption—someone on the inside.
**Logic:** Too clean for outsiders. Had to know the schedule.
**What investigation reveals:** He's right about inside help, but suspects the wrong insider (a senior partner who's actually clean).

### The Consortium's Theory (Guildmaster Vance)
**Suspect:** Tomas, obviously. Case closed.
**Logic:** Means, motive, opportunity. Simple.
**What investigation reveals:** Tomas's alibi has a hole because he was actually doing something embarrassing but innocent (sneaking out to see a romantic interest).

### The Tavern Theory (Marta Greaves)
**Suspect:** The gems were never there in the first place.
**Logic:** "Insurance fraud. It's always insurance fraud with merchants."
**What investigation reveals:** Not fraud, but this line of thinking leads to checking the gem records—which shows Aldric's accounting irregularities.

### Tomas's Theory (the accused)
**Suspect:** The person who saw him near the vault—fellow locksmith **Journeyman Griggs**.
**Logic:** Griggs always hated him. Must have set him up.
**What investigation reveals:** Griggs is a petty jealous person but genuinely saw Tomas. Not involved in the theft.

## Key NPCs

### Captain Verra
- **Appearance:** Weather-worn woman in her forties, practical armor, perpetually tired eyes
- **Want:** The truth. Justice. To not hang an innocent man.
- **Fear:** Political pressure forcing her hand
- **Quirk:** Phrases everything as observations, not opinions. "One might notice..."

### Tomas Brightwell (the accused)
- **Appearance:** Young man, nervous, hasn't slept
- **Want:** To not die for something he didn't do
- **Fear:** That no one will believe him
- **Quirk:** Keeps trying to be helpful, offers to pick locks to prove points

### Aldric Crane (the actual thief)
- **Appearance:** Unremarkable clerk, sweating slightly, very helpful
- **Want:** To get away with it, to survive
- **Fear:** Discovery. He's not a hardened criminal—he's terrified.
- **Quirk:** Over-explains things. Volunteers information no one asked for.

### Guildmaster Vance
- **Appearance:** Wealthy, well-dressed, impatient
- **Want:** Someone to blame. This resolved quickly.
- **Fear:** Deeper investigation (not because he's guilty, but bad for business)
- **Quirk:** Treats everything as a negotiation

## Investigation Beats

### The Scene
The vault shows signs of professional work—too professional for a journeyman locksmith. The lock was picked, but also there are signs of tool marks that don't match Tomas's kit.

### The Witness (Griggs)
Genuinely saw Tomas nearby that night. But under questioning, admits he saw *two* people, not one. Assumed the other was just a shadow.

### The Thieves
Outsiders, staying at a cheap inn on the edge of town. They have the gems (the fakes, actually—Aldric switched them). They'll give up Aldric if caught and pressured—he's not inspiring loyalty.

### The Records
Checking shipping manifests against Aldric's books shows discrepancies. Small things, but they add up.

### Aldric Cracks
He's not built for this. Under questioning, he contradicts himself. If cornered, he breaks down rather than fighting.

## Timeline Pressure

- Day 1: Consortium wants a trial within the week
- Day 3: Captain Verra warns that political pressure is mounting
- Day 5: Mayor might have to act to keep the peace
- Day 7: If unresolved, Tomas faces a rigged trial

## Player Choices Matter

**If they prove Aldric guilty:**
- Tomas is freed, Aldric arrested
- Captain Verra is grateful; players have an ally in the guard
- Consortium is embarrassed but can't argue with evidence

**If they find the thieves but not Aldric:**
- Thieves are arrested, but who hired them?
- Case isn't fully closed; Aldric might escape
- Tomas is probably freed but under suspicion

**If they just prove Tomas innocent (without finding the real culprit):**
- Tomas freed, but Consortium is angry
- The real crime isn't solved; Aldric gets away
- Political tensions remain

**If time runs out:**
- Tomas is convicted
- Players might try a dramatic last-minute save or jailbreak
- Consequences for either approach

## The "Oh Shit" Moment

If energy flags: Aldric panics and tries to flee town. Chase scene through Millhaven's market district.

## Tone Notes

- This is a competent-authorities story, not a corrupt-officials story
- The comedy comes from everyone being wrong in different ways
- Aldric should be sympathetic even as the villain—he's not evil, just desperate
- The player satisfaction is in untangling the mess, not in being the only smart people
