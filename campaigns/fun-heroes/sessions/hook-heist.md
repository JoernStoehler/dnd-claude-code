# The Heist

**Status:** Hook developed, not yet run
**Estimated Runtime:** 3-4 hours
**Location:** Weathervane Manor (see `lore/locations/weathervane-manor.md`)

## The Situation

Weathervane Manor has a new owner—and they're not nice. Maybe it's the mysterious collector who wanted the Locked Room, maybe Cousin Morgana cut a deal with something dark, or maybe one of Erasmus's old creditors has finally claimed the estate.

The players need something from inside. Could be an item of value, evidence to expose the new owner, a person trapped inside, or Aldric himself (if he's still in crystal form somewhere in there).

Time to break into a wizard's house. If they've been here before, the house might remember them—for better or worse.

**If players do nothing:** Whatever they needed is lost. The new owner consolidates power. Future problems become harder.

## Why They're Doing This

Pick or let players choose:

1. **Something valuable is inside:** They know (or heard) about an artifact, document, or treasure. The new owner has it.
2. **Rescue mission:** Someone is trapped inside—Cressida Mopp, an NPC they care about, or something from the Locked Room that's now a prisoner
3. **Evidence:** The new owner is doing something terrible and the proof is inside
4. **Unfinished business:** Aldric (or his ghost) needs one last thing from his workshop
5. **Hired:** Someone else needs them to retrieve something they can't get themselves

## The New Owner

Pick based on campaign direction:

### Option A: Cousin Morgana (Sold Her Soul)
She finally got the estate—by making a deal with whatever Aldric owed. Now she's a puppet of something darker, and the house is changing.

- **Security:** Family retainers, legal threats, eventually supernatural guardians
- **Weakness:** She's not fully in control; the entity she serves has different priorities
- **The twist:** She might actually want to be rescued

### Option B: The Collector (Revealed)
The unknown bidder from the auction was after the Locked Room all along. Now they have access. They're a:
- Rival wizard seeking forbidden knowledge
- Fey lord reclaiming something owed
- Extraplanar entity with unclear motives

- **Security:** Magical wards, summoned creatures, reality-warping effects
- **Weakness:** Focused on the Locked Room; the rest of the house is neglected
- **The twist:** What they want from the Locked Room might actually be dangerous if they get it

### Option C: The Creditor (Directly)
The entity Aldric owed has claimed the estate as payment. They've moved in. The house is... different now.

- **Security:** The house itself serves them; everything is hostile
- **Weakness:** They have rules they must follow; exploit the contract
- **The twist:** They might be willing to negotiate—for a price

## The House Remembers

The key dramatic element: the manor remembers the players from when they owned it.

**This helps:**
- Secret passages they discovered are still accessible
- Objects they were kind to might help (the speaking portraits, certain furniture)
- The house's layout is familiar (no mapping needed)

**This hurts:**
- The new owner knows someone with this knowledge might come back
- Traps have been placed on routes they used before
- Objects they mistreated will hinder them

**Wildcard:** The house might actively want to be liberated from its new owner—or might have accepted its new master fully.

## Heist Structure

### Planning Phase
Players can gather information before attempting entry:
- **Cressida Mopp:** Knows the house, might help for money/revenge
- **Former staff:** Tibalt (the missing butler) might have information if found
- **Public records:** Who owns what, when they're home
- **Staking out:** Watch the manor, note patterns

### Entry Options

| Entry Point | Difficulty | Complication |
|-------------|------------|--------------|
| Front door | Easy (if disguised) | Have to fool the house |
| Servant's entrance | Medium | Old staff might recognize them |
| Cellar | Medium | Contains "experiments" |
| Second-floor window | Medium-Hard | The self-making beds are alert |
| The greenhouse | Hard | Plants are more aggressive now |
| Chimney | Hard | Really? |
| Through the Locked Room | ??? | If they can access it from outside... |

### Complications Inside

Pick 2-3:

**The Patrol**
New security makes regular rounds. Avoiding detection requires timing.

**The Changed Room**
A familiar room is completely different now. What happened here?

**The Alert**
Something they do triggers an alarm. Now it's a race.

**The Moral Test**
They find someone in trouble (servant, prisoner, transformed person). Helping them complicates the heist.

**The Temptation**
They find something valuable that isn't their objective. Take it and risk more exposure?

**The Confrontation**
The new owner knows they're here. But they want to talk, not fight. What do they offer?

## The Objective

What they came for:

### If It's an Object
- Where is it now? (Study, workshop, Locked Room)
- Is it guarded specifically?
- Can they grab it and run, or does retrieving it trigger something?

### If It's a Person
- Are they prisoner, guest, or something in between?
- Do they want to leave?
- Can they move on their own, or do they need to be carried out?

### If It's Evidence
- Documents, witnessed events, or physical proof?
- Will it be believed outside the manor?
- Does taking it alert the owner?

### If It's Aldric (Crystal)
- He might be able to guide them once they're close
- Retrieving him might be what the new owner expects
- Does he still want to be saved? Or has he made a deal?

## Escape

Getting out is its own challenge:

- The route they entered might be blocked
- The house might be actively hostile now
- Other players (factions) might have been waiting for someone to make a move

**Clean escape:** They get out with the objective. Success. Consequences are manageable.

**Messy escape:** They get out, but they're identified or they triggered something. Future repercussions.

**Dramatic escape:** Combat, chase, or confrontation. They get out but it costs them.

**Pyrrhic escape:** They get what they came for but lose something important.

## NPCs

### The New Owner's Lieutenant
(Whoever the second-in-command is)
- **Appearance:** Depends on the owner type
- **Want:** Please their master, maintain order
- **Fear:** Being blamed for security failures
- **Quirk:** Either grimly loyal or secretly hoping for a way out

### Tibalt (The Missing Butler)
If found, he's:
- Hiding in the house, transformed or trapped
- A source of information about changes
- Possibly working for the new owner (willingly or not)
- A wildcard who might help or hinder

## The "Oh Shit" Moment

If energy flags: The new owner catches them but doesn't attack. They have a proposition. They need the players for something. Now it's a negotiation, not an escape.

## Tone Notes

- Heist = planning, tension, then chaos
- The house being semi-sentient adds unpredictability
- The new owner should be formidable but have weaknesses
- Callbacks to the Inheritance session make this more satisfying

## Connections Back

This hook can resolve threads from earlier:
- Aldric's fate (rescued, left behind, or finally dealt with)
- The Locked Room (what was inside? is it loose now?)
- Faction conflicts (resolved or escalated)
- The estate's future (destroyed, freed, or remains a problem)
