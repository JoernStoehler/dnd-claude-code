# The Sentient Cargo

**Status:** Hook developed, not yet run
**Estimated Runtime:** 3-4 hours

## The Situation

A merchant needs something transported from Millhaven to Brackenvale. Simple escort mission—except the "cargo" is sentient, opinionated, and has its own ideas about how this trip should go. It's useful (provides information, magical assistance, or other benefits) but also deeply annoying (criticizes decisions, has demands, won't shut up).

The transport is being done quietly because the cargo's nature is... complicated. There are people who might want to intercept it.

## The Cargo Options

Pick one based on desired tone and player group:

### Option A: The Talking Sword
**Vesper**, a magical sword that belonged to a hero who died before completing a quest. The sword absorbed some of the hero's personality. It needs to reach a shrine in the mountains beyond Brackenvale.

- **Useful:** Can warn of danger (detect enemies), provide tactical advice (usually good), share historical knowledge
- **Annoying:** Constant backseat driving ("I would have gone left"), judgmental about "heroic conduct," tells long stories about its previous wielder
- **Personality:** Pompous, nostalgic, means well, doesn't understand it's not the main character

### Option B: The Diplomatic Gift
**Ambassador Ribbons**, a talking cat who is actually a fey diplomat returning to the forest court after negotiations in Millhaven. Officially a "gift" for the forest spirits. Secretly carrying important political information.

- **Useful:** Knows fey etiquette, can communicate with forest creatures, genuinely charming when they want to be
- **Annoying:** Demands specific foods, criticizes human customs, naps at inconvenient times, casually mentions disturbing fey facts
- **Personality:** Smug, demanding, genuinely cares about the mission but won't admit it

### Option C: The Phylactery (But Not Like That)
**The Vessel**, a crystal containing the preserved consciousness of a dying sage who needs to reach a specific shrine to be transferred into a new host (willing volunteer waiting at the shrine). The sage is lucid but fading.

- **Useful:** Vast knowledge of magic, history, and the region. Can provide spell assistance once per day.
- **Annoying:** Existential dread, random memory tangents, occasionally speaks in dead languages, gets philosophical at bad moments
- **Personality:** Wise but anxious, grateful but also processing mortality, accidentally says creepy things

### Option D: The Heir
**Young Lord Ashworth**, a twelve-year-old noble brat whose family is sending him to "build character" by traveling with adventurers to their remote hunting lodge near Brackenvale. He's not *officially* the cargo, but protecting him is clearly the real job.

- **Useful:** Knows courtly secrets and politics, can authorize expenditures, will eventually develop courage if treated well
- **Annoying:** Demands, complaints, superiority complex, total inexperience with real world
- **Personality:** Sheltered, scared (covers with arrogance), potential to grow

### Option E: The Wizard Who Isn't Dead
**Aldric Weathervane**, the "deceased" transmutation wizard from Weathervane Manor. He didn't die—he transferred his consciousness into a crystal to escape debts he couldn't pay. The armchair corpse was a decoy. Now he needs transport to a shrine (or secretly back to his own workshop) to complete the process and get a new body.

- **Useful:** Brilliant wizard, knows local history, can cast one spell per day through the crystal, knows everything about the estate and its secrets
- **Annoying:** Got himself into this mess, still hasn't learned, makes excuses, wants "quick" detours, vastly overestimates his own cleverness, treats this as a minor inconvenience rather than a crisis
- **Personality:** Distracted academic, chronically avoids responsibility, genuinely likeable despite being the architect of his own problems

**Special connection:** This cargo option ties into the Weathervane Manor story arc (Estate Sale → Inheritance → Heist). Using Aldric here plants seeds for those adventures.

**The followers:** Whoever Aldric owes. Could be:
- The College of Wizardry (he "borrowed" research materials)
- A fey entity he made a bargain with
- The Merchant Consortium (mundane debts)
- Something from the Locked Room

## The Route

Millhaven → Greendale Road → Waymarker Stone → Haverston Farm → Three Oaks → Brackenvale (→ possibly beyond)

**Day 1 Morning:** Departure from Millhaven. Cargo's personality becomes apparent.

**Day 1 Afternoon:** Encounter at Waymarker Stone (see complications).

**Day 1 Evening:** Camp or push on? Cargo has opinions.

**Day 2 Morning:** Forest edge. Different dangers, cargo might be more useful here.

**Day 2 Afternoon:** Arrival at Brackenvale (or destination beyond).

## Complications

Pick 2-3 to populate the journey:

### The Followers
Someone is trailing the group. Their intent depends on which cargo:
- Sword: Collectors who want to "acquire" magical artifacts
- Cat: Rival fey faction who opposes the diplomatic mission
- Vessel: Family members who think the sage should just die peacefully
- Heir: Kidnappers (or worse: his overbearing mother)
- Aldric: His creditors, who've realized the "death" was faked (sets up future hooks)

### The Breakdown
A wheel breaks, a horse goes lame, a bridge is out. The cargo handles adversity poorly (or surprises by handling it well). Time pressure increases.

### The Moral Dilemma
Someone on the road needs help. Stopping delays the mission. The cargo has strong opinions about what heroes should do.

### The Revelation
The cargo reveals something important about itself or the mission that changes the stakes. "Oh, I should mention—there's a reason we're traveling discreetly..."

### The Betrayal
Someone on the road seems helpful (fellow traveler, merchant, passing knight). They're actually after the cargo. The cargo might notice before the players do.

### The Shortcut
The cargo knows a faster route—through less safe territory. Is the time saved worth the risk?

## NPC: The Merchant (Quest Giver)

**Delara Moss**
- **Appearance:** Practical, middle-aged woman, traveling clothes that were expensive but are now road-worn
- **Want:** The cargo delivered safely; she owes someone a favor
- **Fear:** That she's sending these adventurers to their deaths
- **Quirk:** Over-prepares. Hands players three different maps, emergency supplies, written instructions.

## Player Choices Matter

**How they treat the cargo:**
- Patience and respect → cargo becomes genuinely helpful, maybe a recurring ally
- Frustration and dismissal → cargo becomes obstructive, mission gets harder
- Creative engagement → the funniest scenes come from players leaning into the weird

**Whether they protect the cargo at cost:**
- Sacrificing for the mission → cargo is moved, takes the relationship seriously
- Abandoning the cargo when things get hard → consequences depend on cargo type

**What they do when the cargo's interests conflict with the mission:**
- Following the cargo's requests → might get sidetracked but might find rewards
- Overruling the cargo → gets the job done but damages trust

## The "Oh Shit" Moment

If energy flags: the followers catch up and there's a confrontation. The cargo might do something surprising (helpful or complicating).

## Tone Notes

- The cargo should be annoying but *entertainingly* annoying
- Give them moments of genuine usefulness so players don't just resent them
- The cargo should have an arc—start as annoying baggage, end as something more
- This is a road trip comedy with action beats

## Connections

- **Clerk Fenwick** wouldn't post this job officially—too weird—but might quietly recommend the players
- **Marta Greaves** might know Delara Moss or have heard rumors about the cargo
- **Brackenvale** is the destination; villagers react to whatever the cargo is
