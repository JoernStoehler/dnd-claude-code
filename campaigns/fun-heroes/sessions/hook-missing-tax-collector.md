# The Missing Tax Collector

**Status:** Hook developed, not yet run
**Estimated Runtime:** 3-4 hours

## The Situation

Percival Quill, the regional tax collector, has been missing for a week. He was last seen on the road between Millhaven and Brackenvale. The Town Council is worried—not because they liked Percival, but because the Capital will ask questions. The going theory: anti-Crown rebels ambushed and killed him. The actual truth: Percival hated his job, had a secret dream of being a bard, and has run off to start a new life.

**If players do nothing:** The Capital sends investigators. They find Percival's abandoned cart and assume the worst. Crackdowns on "rebel activity" make life harder for everyone.

## Hook

Clerk Fenwick (or the Town Council directly) posts an urgent contract: investigate the disappearance of Percival Quill. The reward is decent, the timeline is tight, and everyone's being cagey about why they're so nervous.

## The Red Herrings

### "Rebel" Evidence
- Percival's cart, found abandoned at the Waymarker Stone
- Scattered tax ledgers (he threw them dramatically)
- Signs of a struggle (he wrestled with his horse)
- No body (because he's alive and performing badly at taverns)

### Local Suspects
- **The Haverstons** (farmers): Owed back taxes. Clearly nervous when questioned. Actually nervous because they're hiding a mundane secret (moonshine operation).
- **Woodcutters from Brackenvale:** Had arguments with Percival about logging fees. Look rough. Actually just grumpy and unhelpful.
- **"Rebels":** There aren't actually organized rebels in this region, but there's a group of young idiots who drink in the forest and complain about taxes. Harmless but will panic if interrogated.

## The Trail

**Stage 1: The Abandoned Cart**
At the Waymarker Stone. Cart intact, horse gone (wandered back to Millhaven, now at a stable). Tax ledgers scattered. Percival's personal bag is missing. A Perception check finds a ripped page with bad poetry.

**Stage 2: Following the Signs**
Tracks lead off the road into fields, then toward the forest edge. He clearly wasn't being chased. Investigation finds: a broken lute string, more bad poetry drafts, a receipt from a traveling music teacher.

**Stage 3: The Music Teacher**
**Madame Viola** travels between towns teaching instruments. She remembers Percival: "Sweet man, terrible voice, paid well, very earnest." She sent him toward Thornbury (a town past Brackenvale, through the forest) where there's a regular open-mic night.

**Stage 4: Finding Percival**
In a tavern in Thornbury (or you can place this in Brackenvale if you want to keep it local). Performing badly under the stage name "Percy Nightingale." He's grown a terrible mustache disguise. He's terrified of being recognized but also clearly having the time of his life.

## Key NPCs

### Percival Quill / "Percy Nightingale"
- **Appearance:** Mid-thirties, soft features, formerly meticulous (now disheveled in an "artistic" way), terrible fake mustache
- **Want:** To be a bard, to never do taxes again, to not get caught
- **Fear:** Being dragged back to his old life. Disappointing his new musician "friends."
- **Quirk:** Speaks in dramatic phrases now. "The ledger of my soul is balanced at last!"

### Madame Viola (Music Teacher)
- **Appearance:** Elderly halfling, carries three instrument cases at all times
- **Want:** Students who pay on time. Quiet dignity.
- **Fear:** Retirement
- **Quirk:** Rates everything on a musical scale. "Your interrogation technique? A solid B-flat."

## Player Choices Matter

**If players bring him back by force:**
- He's miserable, goes through the motions, eventually tries to escape again
- The Town Council is relieved but not grateful—this was an embarrassment
- Percival remembers them as villains in his story

**If players cover for him / help him escape:**
- He's genuinely grateful, writes a (bad) ballad about them
- The "rebel" theory takes hold; may cause problems later
- They've made a friend (and also maybe committed fraud)

**If players negotiate a solution:**
- Maybe Percival pays off his outstanding tax obligation with his savings
- Maybe he agrees to train a replacement first
- This is the "everyone wins" outcome but requires creativity

**If players expose him publicly:**
- Maximum drama, probably funny
- Percival is humiliated, the Council is embarrassed
- "Percy Nightingale" becomes a local joke (which Percival might eventually embrace?)

## The "Oh Shit" Moment

If energy flags: the "forest rebels" (drunk young idiots) stumble into the investigation and make everything more complicated. They think the players are government agents and panic.

## Tone Notes

- The initial briefing should feel serious—missing person, possible murder, political implications
- The trail should gradually get funnier as it becomes clear this is a midlife crisis
- Percival himself is both ridiculous and sympathetic—he's chasing a dream he's bad at
- The conclusion should have real stakes: player choices actually affect outcomes

## Connections

- **Clerk Fenwick** can give the contract and be exasperated about it
- **Marta Greaves** might know Percival—he stayed at the Grinding Gear on collection trips
- **The Haverstons** can be a fun interrogation scene (guilty about moonshine, not murder)
- **Brackenvale villagers** might have seen Percival pass through
