# Clerk Fenwick

**Role:** Administrator, Millhaven Adventurer's Guild Office
**First Appeared:** Not yet

## At a Glance

**Appearance:** Thin, middle-aged man with spectacles perpetually sliding down his nose. Ink-stained fingers. Always has a quill behind one ear and has forgotten about it. Hunched posture from years of leaning over paperwork.

**Demeanor:** Harried but determined. Treats monster-slaying contracts with the same gravity as tax forms. Occasionally pauses mid-conversation to make a note about something unrelated.

**Voice/Speech:** Precise, clipped, slightly nasal. Trails off when consulting internal regulations. "That would require a Form 7-C, which... hmm, we're out of 7-Cs. Well. We'll improvise a 7-B with annotations."

## Motivation

**Want:** To process the backlog. There's always a backlog. If he could just get ahead of the paperwork, everything would be fine.

**Fear:** An audit from the Capital office. His filing system makes sense to him, but he's not sure it would survive outside scrutiny.

**Blind Spot:** Believes the Guild's bureaucracy is helping. Can't see that half the adventurers just take jobs without filing proper paperwork. Genuinely thinks he's the thin line between chaos and order.

## Personality

**On the surface:** Fussy bureaucrat who cares more about forms than heroism.

**Underneath:** Actually cares about adventurers—tries to match them with jobs they'll survive. The paperwork is his way of protecting people. Remembers everyone who didn't come back.

**Quirk:** Categorizes things obsessively. Has names for types of adventurers ("Enthusiastic Novice, Type B"), types of quests ("Pest Control, Escalating"), types of problems ("Recurring Liability").

## Relationships

- **Adventurers:** Exasperated fondness. Wishes they'd fill out forms correctly. Remembers their names.
- **Marta (Grinding Gear):** Sends nervous new adventurers to her. Trusts her judgment of people more than his own.
- **Town Council:** Reports to them quarterly. They don't read his reports.
- **Capital Guild Office:** Sends paperwork to them. Hopes they don't look too closely.

## What He Knows

- Every active contract in the region
- Which adventurers have what specialties (he keeps files)
- Historical records of what problems have occurred where
- The *proper* procedures (even if no one else follows them)

## What He Wants From Players

- Sign the forms. All of them.
- File incident reports (please, he needs the data)
- Survive (he hates updating the deceased ledger)
- Maybe bring back proof so he can close out the contract properly

## Stats (If Needed)

**Combat:** Non-combatant. Will hide under his desk if things get violent.

**Key Skills:** Investigation (finding information in his files), History (Guild records), Insight (surprisingly good at reading adventurers after all these years)
