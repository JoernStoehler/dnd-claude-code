# Marta Greaves

**Role:** Innkeeper, The Grinding Gear (Millhaven)
**First Appeared:** Not yet

## At a Glance

**Appearance:** Stocky woman in her fifties, gray-streaked hair pulled back severely, perpetually flour-dusted apron. Arms that suggest she's thrown out bigger problems than adventurers. Resting "I've seen worse" face.

**Demeanor:** Unflappable. Patient in the way of someone who's decided nothing is worth getting upset about anymore. Will listen to your whole dramatic story while wiping down the bar.

**Voice/Speech:** Flat, unhurried, dry. Drops observations that could be jokes but delivered without any indication she thinks they're funny. "Blood's extra to clean up. Just so you know."

## Motivation

**Want:** A quiet evening. (Never gets one.)

**Fear:** Nothing obvious. She's made peace with a chaotic profession. Deepest fear might be that her tavern becomes truly boring—she'd never admit it, but she likes having stories to tell.

**Blind Spot:** Assumes she's seen everything. Occasionally gets genuinely surprised, which she covers by acting even more unimpressed.

## Personality

**On the surface:** Seen it all, done it all, cleaned up after most of it.

**Underneath:** Actually enjoys the chaos, just won't give anyone the satisfaction. Has quietly helped more adventurers than she'll admit. Respects competence and effort.

**Quirk:** Keeps a running tally of damages in her head and will recite it at surprising moments. "That's seventeen chairs this year. The year is young."

## Relationships

- **Town Council:** Polite mutual tolerance. They need her tavern for unofficial business.
- **Adventurer's Guild:** Fenwick sends recruits to her for "real" information
- **Regular patrons:** Knows their orders, their dramas, their tab limits
- **Troublemakers:** Remembers them. They learn not to come back.

## What She Knows

- Every rumor in Millhaven passes through the Grinding Gear eventually
- Who's hiring, who's in trouble, who's not what they seem
- Which adventurers are competent vs. which are going to get themselves killed
- Local history (her family's been here generations)

## What She Wants From Players

- Pay your tab
- Don't break too much furniture
- If you're going to cause trouble, make it interesting
- Keep the stories coming (but she won't ask)

## Stats (If Needed)

**Combat:** Commoner stats, but she has a club behind the bar and knows how to use it. More importantly, she knows when *not* to fight.

**Key Skills:** Insight (reads people instantly), History (local), Intimidation (quiet but effective)
