# Elder Cornelius Marsh

**Role:** Village Elder, Brackenvale
**First Appeared:** Not yet

## At a Glance

**Appearance:** Tall, thin man in his seventies who still stands very straight. White hair, wispy beard, watery blue eyes that can look surprisingly sharp. Wears formal clothes that were fashionable forty years ago and are now just his look.

**Demeanor:** Dignified to the point of self-parody. Treats every village matter as if it might be recorded in history books. Speaks in pronouncements.

**Voice/Speech:** Slow, measured, with dramatic pauses. Enjoys the sound of his own voice. Often starts with "In my years as Elder..." or "The village has faced many trials, but..."

## Motivation

**Want:** Recognition. Respect. For people to understand that Brackenvale is important and so, by extension, is he.

**Fear:** Irrelevance. Being forgotten. The idea that he's spent thirty years leading a village that doesn't matter.

**Blind Spot:** Thinks he's a great leader when he's mostly just been present for a long time. The village runs itself; he provides commentary.

## Personality

**On the surface:** Pompous, self-important, prone to melodrama. Every inconvenience is "a crisis the likes of which Brackenvale has never seen."

**Underneath:** Genuinely loves Brackenvale and its people. His dramatics come from caring too much, not too little. When things are actually serious, he gets quieter and more effective.

**Quirk:** Has a speech prepared for every occasion. Often pulls out wrong speech. "Wait, that was my harvest festival remarks. Let me—no, that's the one for if we're invaded by orcs. Ah, here we are."

## Relationships

- **Villagers:** Tolerate him fondly. Tune out during speeches. Actually respect him more than he realizes.
- **Widow Hesta:** His opposite—she's practical while he's performative. They bicker, but it's comfortable.
- **Sage Willowmere:** The only person he defers to. She's been here longer.
- **Young Tam:** Sees himself in the boy. Encourages his watchtower duties perhaps too much.
- **Millhaven:** Slightly resentful of the big town. Insists Brackenvale is just as important.

## What He Knows

- Every minor incident in Brackenvale's history (will tell you unprompted)
- Who's feuding with whom in the village
- The forest and mountain signs that indicate trouble coming
- Where the village's emergency supplies are (he checks weekly)

## What He Wants From Players

- Listen to his full speech (no one ever does)
- Treat the village's problems with appropriate gravity
- Report back to him so he can feel in charge
- Maybe mention him favorably if they talk to anyone important

## Stats (If Needed)

**Combat:** Non-combatant. Would try to talk down a threat first. In actual danger, would protect villagers before himself.

**Key Skills:** History (local, will tell you unprompted), Performance (speeches), Persuasion (actually decent when he drops the act)
