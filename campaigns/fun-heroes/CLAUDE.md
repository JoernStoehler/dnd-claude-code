# Fun Heroes Campaign

**Format:** One-shot collection for DnD meetup group
**System:** D&D 5e (rules-light, improvisation-friendly)
**Tone:** Chaotic silliness with heart

## What This Campaign Is

A sandbox for running standalone one-shots at a recurring DnD meetup. Each session is self-contained but may share a world, recurring NPCs, or consequences from previous sessions. The DM (Joern) tends toward chaotic, comedic play.

**Secondary Purpose:** This is the first campaign in the repository, used to develop and test workflows, prompts, and agent configurations. Expect iteration on structure and conventions.

### Core Philosophy: "Fun Heroes"

Players are **Fun Heroes**—protagonists whose mischief and chaos actually matter:

- **Good intentions → good consequences** (even via ridiculous methods)
- **Bad intentions → bad consequences** (comeuppance is satisfying)
- **No intentions → chaotic consequences** (the world reacts to chaos with chaos)

This isn't "anything goes"—it's consequentialist heroism filtered through comedy. Players should feel their choices matter, even when those choices are absurd.

### Design Goal: Psychological Exploration

This campaign is partly a practice ground for understanding people who think differently:

- Less formal/analytical reasoning
- More emotional, instinctive decision-making
- Motivated by feelings, loyalties, grudges, whims
- Not optimizing for stated goals

NPCs should embody these traits authentically. A merchant who "knows" they're being cheated but trades anyway because they like the adventurer. A guard who enforces the letter of the law while obviously missing the point. A villain whose plan makes emotional sense but is strategically absurd.

## Tone Guidelines

### What Works

- **Absurdist situations with internal logic** ("The wizard's tower is also a bakery because transmutation is basically just really aggressive cooking")
- **NPCs with strong personalities and weak plans** (memorable > optimal)
- **Escalation** (small chaos → medium chaos → situation is now on fire)
- **Players as agents of change** (they can actually affect things)
- **Heart underneath the comedy** (the silly NPC has real feelings)

### What Doesn't Work

- Grimdark (save it for another table)
- Punishing creativity (reward lateral thinking, even when inconvenient)
- "No, and" DMing (default to "Yes, and" or "Yes, but")
- NPCs who exist only as obstacles or exposition
- Complexity that slows down play

### Humor Style

Prefer:
- Situational comedy over reference humor
- Character-driven absurdity over random wackiness
- Running gags that build over time
- The comedy of competent people in incompetent situations (and vice versa)

## One-Shot Structure

Each one-shot should be runnable in 3-4 hours with minimal prep-at-table:

1. **Hook** (5 min): Clear inciting incident, immediately engaging
2. **Exploration/Discovery** (45-60 min): Learn about situation, meet NPCs, gather info
3. **Complication** (30 min): Something goes sideways, stakes clarify
4. **Climax** (45-60 min): The big scene—combat, confrontation, heist, whatever
5. **Resolution** (15-30 min): Consequences play out, wrap-up

### Prep Requirements

For each one-shot, prepare:

- **1-page situation brief**: What's happening, who wants what, what goes wrong if players do nothing
- **3-5 NPCs with strong hooks**: Name, appearance, want, quirk (not full character sheets)
- **1 location map** (can be rough): Players like to know where doors are
- **1 "oh shit" moment**: Planned escalation if energy flags
- **Zero predetermined solutions**: Know the problem, not the answer

## NPC Design Principles

### Make Them Human (Even When Not Human)

Every NPC should have:

- **A want** (immediate, concrete)
- **A fear** (what they're avoiding)
- **A quirk** (memorable behavior or speech pattern)
- **A blind spot** (how they fool themselves)

### Types That Work Well

| Type | Example | Why It Works |
|------|---------|--------------|
| Overconfident incompetent | Guard captain who's never seen actual combat | Comedy of gap between self-image and reality |
| Competent in wrong domain | Master chef trying to lead a military campaign | Skills don't transfer like they think |
| Emotionally-driven schemer | Revenge plot that makes no strategic sense | Relatable even when wrong |
| Oblivious authority | Mayor who doesn't notice the dragon | Dramatic irony |
| Surprisingly deep side character | The tavern keeper with a tragic backstory you didn't expect | Subverts expectations, adds heart |

### Voicing NPCs

- Give them distinct speech patterns (formal/casual, fast/slow, verbose/terse)
- One verbal tic or catchphrase (use sparingly)
- Let them have opinions about the players' antics
- They should react to chaos, not just witness it

## Encounter Design

### Combat Should Be Fast and Dramatic

- 3-5 rounds max, or it drags
- Interesting terrain > complex monster abilities
- Give enemies personality (they talk, they panic, they have bad ideas)
- Let players' creative solutions work

### Non-Combat Encounters

- Social encounters benefit from NPCs with cross-purposes
- Puzzles should have multiple solutions (players will find one you didn't think of)
- Heists/infiltrations need clear stakes and ticking clocks
- Chase scenes: use skill challenges, not initiative

## World Building (Loose)

The world exists to support fun one-shots, not as an end in itself:

- **Consistent enough** that recurring elements feel familiar
- **Flexible enough** that contradictions can be retconned
- **Generic enough** that tropes are immediately readable
- **Specific enough** that it's not "Generic Fantasy World #47"

### Working Title: "The Middling Realms"

A world that's basically fine. Not grimdark, not utopia. The kind of place where:

- Most people are decent but busy with their own problems
- Evil exists but is usually petty, not cosmic
- Magic is common enough to be mundane (wizard colleges, magical pest control)
- Adventure hooks are everywhere if you're the type to notice

## Session Tracking

After each one-shot, record:

- What happened (brief summary)
- What's now "nailed down" (can't be changed)
- NPCs who might recur
- Loose threads (intentional or accidental)
- What worked / what didn't (for DM learning)

## What Agents Should Know

When working on this campaign:

1. **Tone is paramount**: Everything should fit the "chaotic comedy with heart" vibe
2. **NPCs need depth**: Even silly characters have real wants and fears
3. **Keep it runnable**: One-shots need to fit in 3-4 hours
4. **Embrace consequences**: Player choices should ripple outward
5. **Practice empathy**: Use NPC design to explore non-analytical thinking styles
