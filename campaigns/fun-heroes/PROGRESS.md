## What's Ready to Run Right Now

### Grab-and-Go (minimal prep)

1. **Sentient Cargo** — Most polished. Route detailed, NPCs ready, item voices defined. Just pick complications.

### Ready with 15-30 min prep

2. **Inheritance** — Read hot-potato structure, pick which heirs are available, review Ledger of Debts.
3. **Estate Sale** — Read factions, decide what items are being auctioned, pick complications.
4. **Heist** — Pick the new owner, decide what players need, review entry points.

### Need More Work

5. **Missing Tax Collector** — Situation clear but needs Percival fleshed out, trail of evidence.
6. **Wrongly Accused** — Needs suspects developed, actual crime detailed.

### Not Ready

7. **Festival Disaster** — Concept only
8. **Monster Mediation** — Concept only
9. **Tournament** — Concept only
10. **Inspection** — Concept only

## Improvement Priorities (Not a Backlog)

These are areas that would increase readiness if developed. No order implied.

**High Impact (Gameplay):**
- [ ] Develop NPC voices (practice speaking as them)
- [ ] Add plotlines section to Sentient Cargo file
- [ ] Flesh out Missing Tax Collector (Percival's trail)
- [ ] Flesh out Wrongly Accused (the actual crime and suspects)

**High Impact (Visual/Structural):**
- [ ] Weathervane Manor floor plans (3 floors + basement)
- [ ] Manor item placement (where is everything specifically?)
- [ ] Manor hidden secrets (what can players discover?)
- [ ] Escort route visual/map with encounter markers

**Medium Impact:**
- [ ] Millhaven city map (districts, streets, key buildings)
- [ ] Brackenvale village map (buildings, paths)
- [ ] Greendale Reach area map (terrain, scale, landmarks)
- [ ] Write auction mechanics for Estate Sale
- [ ] Detail Heist security options per owner type
- [ ] Level-adjustable encounters for Manor
- [ ] Quest-dependent state changes for Manor (during + after each hook)
- [ ] Develop one undeveloped hook (Festival? Monster Mediation?)

**Low Priority:**
- [ ] Cosmology/gods (only if a hook needs it)
- [ ] Monster ecology (only if relevant)
- [ ] Detailed history (only if plot requires)
- [ ] Beyond-sandbox geography (only if players go there)
- [ ] Random encounter tables for routes

## Notes

- Percentages are conservative estimates

- Item plotlines exist (brainstormed in conversation) but not yet added to file
- Route NPCs can recur in other hooks if players met them
