# The Middling Realms

A world that's basically fine.

## Core Concept

The Middling Realms exist in the comfortable middle of the fantasy spectrum. Not plagued by existential threats, not blessed with eternal peace. It's a place where:

- Kingdoms squabble over trade routes, not the fate of existence
- Dragons exist but mostly stick to their territories (property values are better there)
- Dark lords rise occasionally, get defeated, rise again, seem tired
- Most evil is banal: greedy merchants, petty officials, lazy guards

## The Comedic Engine

The world generates comedy through:

**Competence Mismatches**
- Powerful beings with terrible judgment
- Wise sages who can't manage their own households
- Legendary heroes who are extremely bad at normal life

**Institutions That Almost Work**
- The Adventurer's Guild: bureaucracy meets dungeon-delving
- The College of Wizardry: academia with fireball access
- The Royal Court: Game of Thrones but everyone is kind of dumb

**Magic As Mundane**
- Magical pest control (rat catchers with wands)
- Enchanted household items (self-stirring pots, argumentative furniture)
- Spell-powered industry (and the union disputes that follow)

## Geography

### Our Sandbox: Greendale Reach

See `locations/greendale-reach.md` for full details. Quick reference:

| Location | Type | File |
|----------|------|------|
| Millhaven | Market town (starting hub) | `locations/millhaven.md` |
| Brackenvale | Village (adventure-adjacent) | `locations/brackenvale.md` |
| Greendale Road | Connecting route | `locations/greendale-reach.md` |
| Thornwood Forest | Wild (east) | — |
| Greypeak Foothills | Wild (north) | — |

### Beyond the Sandbox

Still loosely defined. Add when one-shots need them:

- A capital city (west) - big, messy, bureaucratic
- Coastal ports (south) - trade, pirates, sea monsters
- The Greypeak Mountains proper (north) - dragons, dwarves, dungeons
- Deep Thornwood (east) - fey courts, ancient ruins, unknown

**The Rule:** If a one-shot needs a location type, it exists. Nail down specifics only when revealed to players.

## Factions (Starter Ideas)

| Faction | What They Want | Why They're Funny |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Adventurer's Guild | Regulate adventuring | More concerned with paperwork than dragons |
| Merchant Consortium | Money, obviously | Cartoonishly greedy, but also employs half the city |
| Royal Court | Stay in power | Infighting over trivial matters while missing big ones |
| College of Wizardry | Knowledge, funding | Academic politics + magical accidents |
| Temple of [Generic Good God] | Do good | Completely disagree on what "good" means |
| The Underworld | Crime stuff | Surprisingly professional, weirdly ethical in spots |

## Recurring Character Types

**The Functionary**
A bureaucrat who technically has authority over the situation. Follows rules that make no sense. Can be helped or hindered depending on how players approach them.

**The Schemer**
Someone with a plan that seems clever to them. Usually involves revenge, romance, or getting rich. Plan has obvious flaws they can't see.

**The Expert**
Master of one thing, clueless about everything else. Will help gladly if asked about their specialty, become useless or dangerous outside it.

**The True Believer**
Sincerely devoted to a cause, organization, or person. Their faith is touching and also the source of their blind spots.

## One-Shot Hooks

### Standalone (ready to run)

| Hook | File | Summary |
|------|------|---------|
| The Missing Tax Collector | `sessions/hook-missing-tax-collector.md` | Percival Quill ran off to be a bard. Initial theory: murdered by rebels. |
| The Wrongly Accused | `sessions/hook-wrongly-accused.md` | Competent authorities need outside investigators. Everyone has a wrong suspect. |
| The Sentient Cargo | `sessions/hook-sentient-cargo.md` | Transport five bickering sentient items. Obvious why owner sold them. |

### The Weathervane Arc (connected hooks)

Three hooks centered on a wizard's estate that changes hands constantly. Can run in any order—the manor's ownership is always in flux, with current owners rarely even present. See `lore/locations/weathervane-manor.md` for the shared location.

| Hook | File | Summary |
|------|------|---------|
| The Estate Sale | `sessions/hook-estate-sale.md` | Auction chaos. Factions compete. Players might acquire something dangerous. |
| The Inheritance | `sessions/hook-inheritance.md` | Players own the manor—briefly. Race to dump it on someone before debts activate. |
| The Heist | `sessions/hook-heist.md` | Someone else owns the manor. Players need something from inside. |

**Note:** The manor changes hands so often that the "current owner" is usually just a name on paper—someone who hasn't moved in yet, has already fled, or is dealing with their own problems elsewhere.

**Connection:** The Sentient Cargo items may have come from Weathervane Manor (see Option D in that hook).

### Ideas (not yet developed)

1. **The Festival Disaster** - Annual celebration threatened. Must save it without ruining festivities.

2. **Monster Mediation** - The "monster" has legitimate grievances. Both sides partly right.

3. **The Tournament** - Winning matters less than what happens during it.

4. **The Inspection** - Important official coming. Everything is not fine.

## What's Established

- **Locations:** Millhaven, Brackenvale, Greendale Reach, Weathervane Manor
- **NPCs:** Marta Greaves (innkeeper), Clerk Fenwick (guild), Elder Cornelius Marsh (elder), Aldric Weathervane (maybe-dead wizard)
- **Standalone one-shots:** Missing Tax Collector, Wrongly Accused, Sentient Cargo
- **Connected arc:** Estate Sale → Cargo → Inheritance → Heist (4-part Weathervane Manor story)

## What's Not Here (Yet)

- City maps
- Detailed history
- Cosmology/gods
- Monster ecology
- The capital, coast, or deep wilds

Add these when one-shots require them. Don't pre-build what might never be used.
