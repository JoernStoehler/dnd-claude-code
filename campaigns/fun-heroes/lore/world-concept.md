# The Middling Realms

A world that's basically fine.

## Core Concept

The Middling Realms exist in the comfortable middle of the fantasy spectrum. Not plagued by existential threats, not blessed with eternal peace. It's a place where:

- Kingdoms squabble over trade routes, not the fate of existence
- Dragons exist but mostly stick to their territories (property values are better there)
- Dark lords rise occasionally, get defeated, rise again, seem tired
- Most evil is banal: greedy merchants, petty officials, lazy guards

## The Comedic Engine

The world generates comedy through:

**Competence Mismatches**
- Powerful beings with terrible judgment
- Wise sages who can't manage their own households
- Legendary heroes who are extremely bad at normal life

**Institutions That Almost Work**
- The Adventurer's Guild: bureaucracy meets dungeon-delving
- The College of Wizardry: academia with fireball access
- The Royal Court: Game of Thrones but everyone is kind of dumb

**Magic As Mundane**
- Magical pest control (rat catchers with wands)
- Enchanted household items (self-stirring pots, argumentative furniture)
- Spell-powered industry (and the union disputes that follow)

## Geography (Sketch)

Keep it loose. Add details only when one-shots need them.

**Known Areas:**
- A capital city (name TBD) - big, messy, bureaucratic
- Surrounding farmland - pastoral, occasionally monster-adjacent
- A forest that's probably magical - standard mysterious woods
- Mountains with the usual dwarves/dragons/danger
- A coast with ports - trade, pirates, sea monsters
- Neighboring kingdoms that might be rivals

**The Rule:** If a one-shot needs a location type, it exists. Nail down specifics only when revealed to players.

## Factions (Starter Ideas)

| Faction | What They Want | Why They're Funny |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Adventurer's Guild | Regulate adventuring | More concerned with paperwork than dragons |
| Merchant Consortium | Money, obviously | Cartoonishly greedy, but also employs half the city |
| Royal Court | Stay in power | Infighting over trivial matters while missing big ones |
| College of Wizardry | Knowledge, funding | Academic politics + magical accidents |
| Temple of [Generic Good God] | Do good | Completely disagree on what "good" means |
| The Underworld | Crime stuff | Surprisingly professional, weirdly ethical in spots |

## Recurring Character Types

**The Functionary**
A bureaucrat who technically has authority over the situation. Follows rules that make no sense. Can be helped or hindered depending on how players approach them.

**The Schemer**
Someone with a plan that seems clever to them. Usually involves revenge, romance, or getting rich. Plan has obvious flaws they can't see.

**The Expert**
Master of one thing, clueless about everything else. Will help gladly if asked about their specialty, become useless or dangerous outside it.

**The True Believer**
Sincerely devoted to a cause, organization, or person. Their faith is touching and also the source of their blind spots.

## One-Shot Hooks (Brainstorm)

These are starting points, not finished adventures:

1. **The Missing Tax Collector** - Everyone's relieved he's gone, but someone important wants him found. Turns out he ran off to become a bard.

2. **The Wizard's Estate Sale** - A dead wizard's possessions are being auctioned. Everything is slightly cursed. Multiple parties want specific items.

3. **The Festival Disaster** - Annual celebration threatened by [monster/weather/political intrigue]. Must be saved without ruining the festivities.

4. **The Wrongly Accused** - Someone's clearly innocent of the crime they're accused of. The real criminal is obvious to everyone except the authorities.

5. **The Inheritance** - Party inherits something from a relative they didn't know. Could be property, a title, a debt, a vendetta, or something stranger.

6. **The Escort Mission** - Transport someone/something from A to B. The cargo has opinions about the route.

7. **Monster Mediation** - The "monster" terrorizing the village has legitimate grievances. Both sides are a little bit right.

8. **The Heist** - Something needs stealing from someone who probably deserves it. Security is elaborate but has blind spots.

9. **The Tournament** - Competition where winning matters less than what happens during it. Sabotage, romance, old rivalries.

10. **The Inspection** - Important official is coming to inspect [location/organization]. Everything's fine. Everything is not fine.

## What's Not Here (Yet)

- Specific city maps
- Named NPCs
- Detailed history
- Cosmology/gods
- Monster ecology

Add these when one-shots require them. Don't pre-build what might never be used.
