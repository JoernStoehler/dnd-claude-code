#### Workshop (WS)
**On entry:** Multiple transmutation circles on the floor—some still faintly glowing. Workbenches with tools and half-finished experiments.

| Feature | DC | Effect |
|---------|-----|--------|

**CRUCIBLE CLUE:** Aldric's notes include: *"Tried 'Locked Room', 'Sanctum', 'Laboratory'—the Wandering Door doesn't respond. What did the old man call it?"*

---

#### Cold Storage (C)
**On entry:** Meat hooks (empty). Stasis jars on shelves. Unpleasantly cold (not natural).

| Feature | DC | Effect |

| Supernatural cold | — | Long rest here: no benefit, exhaustion |

**Items:** Stasis jars, mysterious key

---

#### The Locked Room (LR)
**On entry:** You can't enter. Heavy iron door, no visible lock, no keyhole, no handle.

| Feature | DC | Effect |
|---------|-----|--------|
| Force the door | — | Impossible by normal means |
| Detect Magic | Arcana 10 (automatic with spell) | Abjuration (warding) and Conjuration (portal?) |
| Listen at door | Perception 18 | Faint sound—breathing? machinery? |
| The mysterious key | — | Doesn't fit (no keyhole), but glows faintly near the door |

**THE SECRET:** The room has a true name—**"The Crucible"**—which Erasmus used for his private work. The Wandering Door *can* connect here if someone speaks this name. The iron door is a decoy; the real entrance was always the Wandering Door.

### Ways to Access the Locked Room

| Method | How to Learn | Execution |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| **The True Name** | Find clues (see below) | Say "The Crucible" near the Wandering Door |
| **The Mysterious Key** | Found in Cold Storage stasis jar | Hold key to iron door + speak Erasmus's full name (Perception 18 to hear it whispered back) |
| **Blood of the Line** | Cousin Morgana or College researchers know | A Weathervane descendant touches the door while willing it open |
| **Dispel Magic** | Any caster | 7th level or higher suppresses ward (1 minute) |
| **The Bound One's Permission** | Negotiate via the Ledger | If the debt is addressed, the Bound One may unlock it |

### Clues to the True Name

Scattered throughout the manor. Players need 2-3 to piece it together:

| Location | Clue | DC to Find | What It Says |
|----------|------|------------|--------------|
| **Library** (diary) | Perception 12 | Fragmentary entry: *"...returned to my crucible below, the only place they cannot reach..."* |
| **Observatory** (star charts) | Arcana 14 | A chart labeled "Crucible Alignment" with a date 20 years ago |
| **Entry Hall** (Erasmus portrait) | Persuasion 15 | If asked about his "greatest work": *"Ah, the Crucible... I shouldn't say more."* Then refuses to elaborate |
| **Workshop** (Aldric's notes) | Investigation 13 | Note reads: *"Tried 'Locked Room', 'Sanctum', 'Laboratory'—the Wandering Door doesn't respond. What did the old man call it?"* |
| **Study** (correspondence) | Investigation 16 | Letter from the College: *"We remain interested in acquiring your 'Crucible' research..."* |

**GM Note:** Don't require all clues. If players have 2 and make the connection, reward them. If they're stuck, the Erasmus portrait can be prompted to slip ("What was that room you mentioned? The... Crew-something?").

---

## The Ledger of Debts

Found in the study safe. A magical ledger that records all debts owed to and by the estate.

**Properties:**
- Entries appear in Erasmus's handwriting, even new ones
- Cannot be destroyed by normal means
- Ownership of the estate transfers the debts

**Current entries (GM picks which to reveal):**
| Owed To | Amount/Nature | Status |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| Various merchants | 500gp total | Payable |
| College of Wizardry | "Research materials" | Negotiable |
| "The Bound One" | "As agreed" | Unpayable? |
| Creditors of Aldric | 2,000gp | Fled |

The "Bound One" entry is the oldest debt. No other details. This connects to the Locked Room.

## Critical Paths by Hook

### Estate Sale (60-90 minutes in manor)

**Goal:** Attend auction, acquire items, snoop around
**Permitted areas:** Ground floor, some of second floor
**Key locations:**
1. **Great Room** — Auction happens here
2. **Study** — Restricted, but the good stuff is here (Ledger)
3. **Entry Hall** — Coming and going, notice the clock

**Likely path:** Entry → Great Room (auction) → sneak to Study (if investigating)
**Complications:** Other bidders, Consortium guards, accidental Wandering Door activation

---

### Inheritance (90-120 minutes in manor)

**Goal:** Explore your new property, discover why no one keeps it, find someone to take it
**Permitted areas:** Entire house (you own it)
**Key locations:**
1. **Study** — Find the Ledger, understand the debts
2. **Workshop** — Learn about Erasmus's research
3. **Library** — Erasmus's notes and diary
4. **The Locked Room** — Discover you can't open it

**Likely path:** Entry → explore ground floor → second floor → discover Ledger → investigate basement → encounter Locked Room → panic → find heir
**Complications:** House quirks (beds, coats, harpsichord), escalating supernatural hints, the debt collector arrives

---

### Heist (90-120 minutes in manor)

**Goal:** Retrieve objective from hostile manor
**Entry points by difficulty:**
| Entry | DC | Notes |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Servant's entrance | 10 | Easiest, but kitchen may be occupied |
| Study window | 12 | Quiet, direct to valuables |
| Library window | 14 | Second floor, harder climb |
| Coal chute | 16 | Basement access, tight squeeze |
| Observatory dome | 18 | Dramatic but difficult |

**Key locations depend on objective:**
- **Item retrieval:** Study (safe), Workshop (tools), Storage (random valuables)
- **Person rescue:** Basement (Cold Storage) or Master Bedroom (prisoner)
- **Evidence:** Study (documents), Library (correspondence)
- **Aldric (crystal):** Workshop or hidden in Storage

**Likely path:** Entry point → navigate to objective → avoid patrols → retrieve → escape
**Complications:** The house may help or hinder (see "House Remembers" in hook-heist.md)

---

## Quick Encounter Table

Roll or choose when players do something unexpected:

| d6 | Encounter |
|----|-----------|
| 1 | A speaking portrait offers unsolicited advice (50% helpful, 50% misleading) |
| 2 | Furniture animates briefly (coat rack, chair, bed)—not hostile, just startling |
| 3 | The Wandering Door activates from someone's casual mention of a room |
| 4 | A previous owner's trap triggers (poison needle, falling books, thunder glyph) |
| 5 | Something in the basement makes a sound (The Locked Room? An experiment?) |
| 6 | A seemingly mundane object turns out to be a transmutation experiment |
