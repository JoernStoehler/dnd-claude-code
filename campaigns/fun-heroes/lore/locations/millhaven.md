# Millhaven

**Type:** Market town (starting hub)
**Population:** ~2,000
**Vibe:** Busy, bureaucratic, basically functional

## Overview

Millhaven sits at the confluence of the Slow River and the King's Road, making it a natural trading hub for the surrounding region. It's not important enough for nobles to fight over, but prosperous enough that people care about property disputes. The kind of town where the biggest drama is usually "whose cart blocked the bridge."

The town is named for its mill—a large waterwheel operation that grinds grain for half the region. The mill is loud, ever-present, and the miller's family has opinions about everything.

## Why Adventurers Come Here

- **Adventurer's Guild Office:** Handles contracts, bounties, and the paperwork that apparently comes with monster-slaying
- **Crossroads:** Roads lead to the capital (west), the coast (south), the mountains (north), and various villages (east)
- **Services:** Decent inn, blacksmith, general store, temple, and a surprising number of lawyers

## Key Locations

### The Grinding Gear (Tavern/Inn)
The main adventurer hangout. Named for a gear from the old mill that hangs over the bar. Good ale, mediocre food, excellent rumors. The innkeeper, **Marta Greaves**, has seen everything and is impressed by nothing.

### Millhaven Adventurer's Guild Office
A cramped building that used to be a tannery (it still smells faintly). Staffed by **Clerk Fenwick**, who treats adventuring contracts like tax documents. There's always a quest board, and there's always a backlog.

### The Mill
Can't miss it—you can hear it from anywhere in town. Run by the **Tumbleton family**, who've operated it for four generations and believe this gives them authority over civic matters.

### Temple of the Balanced Scales
Dedicated to a god of commerce and fair dealing. The priest, **Brother Aldric**, genuinely believes in fairness and is constantly disappointed by everyone. Offers healing (for reasonable donations).

### Town Hall
Where the **Town Council** meets to argue about bridge repairs, market fees, and whose responsibility the rats are. Meetings are technically public. They're also interminable.

## Town Character

**What makes it funny:**
- Bureaucracy that's annoying but not malicious
- Everyone has an opinion about the mill noise
- The Adventurer's Guild is treated like any other trade—complete with licensing concerns
- Petty rivalries that have been going for decades (no one remembers why)

**What makes it functional:**
- Most people are decent; they're just busy
- Problems actually get solved (eventually, after committees)
- There's genuine community here, even if it's grumpy

## Hooks That Start Here

- Someone in the tavern needs help
- The Town Council has a problem they can't solve with meetings
- Something's wrong at the mill
- A merchant needs an escort somewhere
