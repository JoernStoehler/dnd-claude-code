# Weathervane Manor

**Type:** Wizard's estate (recurring location)
**Location:** Just outside Millhaven, on a hill overlooking the Slow River
**Status:** Currently between owners (again)

## Overview

Weathervane Manor was built by **Erasmus Weathervane**, a transmutation wizard who vanished without explanation twenty years ago. Since then, the estate has changed hands more times than anyone can count. Each owner adds something, loses something, and eventually leaves—willingly or otherwise.

The manor is known for:
- Rooms that don't quite stay where you left them
- Objects that are "slightly" cursed (more annoying than dangerous)
- Secrets from a dozen previous owners, most forgotten
- A reputation that makes normal buyers... hesitant
- The fact that no one keeps it for long

## The Vanished Wizard: Erasmus Weathervane

Twenty years ago, Erasmus Weathervane was a respected (if eccentric) transmutation specialist. One morning, he simply wasn't there. No body, no note, no magical residue. His breakfast was still warm.

**What people know:**
- He was working on something in the basement
- He had debts—mundane and otherwise
- The Locked Room was his private sanctum
- He may have left voluntarily, or not

**What people suspect:**
- He found a way to escape his creditors permanently
- Something from the Locked Room got him
- He's still in the house, transformed into something
- He achieved some kind of transcendence (or oblivion)

**The truth:** Unknown. Revealing it should be dramatic.

## Twenty Years of Owners

Each owner left their mark. Some additions are useful, some are problems, most are both.

| Owner | Era | What They Added | Why They Left |
|-------|-----|-----------------|---------------|
| Erasmus Weathervane | Founder | The house itself, the Locked Room, core enchantments | Vanished mysteriously |
| The Consortium (briefly) | Year 1 | Nothing (tried to liquidate, failed) | "Legal complications" |
| Lady Ashworth | Years 2-4 | The speaking portraits, refinished great room | Debts came due |
| Magister Thorn | Years 5-7 | Workshop improvements, protective wards | Something in the basement |
| The Cult of the Closed Eye | Year 8 | Probably nothing good | Adventurers |
| Three separate families | Years 9-14 | Normal renovations, some fled mid-project | Various (none good) |
| Aldric Weathervane (distant cousin) | Years 15-20 | More experiments, more complications | "Died" recently |

**Current status:** Aldric's estate is being liquidated. Again.

## Aldric Weathervane (The Most Recent Owner)

A distant cousin who inherited on a technicality. He was a transmutation hobbyist who thought he could "figure out" the house. He was wrong.

**What happened to him:** Officially, "magical accident." His body was found transformed into an armchair. But Aldric was cleverer than he looked—he actually transferred his consciousness into a crystal to escape his mounting debts. The armchair was a decoy.

**If using the Sentient Cargo hook:** Aldric (as a crystal) can be one of the cargo options. He knows the house's recent secrets but not Erasmus's originals.

## The Estate Itself

### Main House

Three stories of stone and timber, built sensibly and then modified magically by a succession of owners. The architecture reflects twenty years of "improvements."

**Ground Floor:**
- **Entry Hall:** Coats hang themselves (Erasmus). Sometimes on people who didn't want them (malfunction).
- **Great Room:** Self-playing harpsichord (Lady Ashworth). Only knows five songs. Plays them constantly.
- **Dining Room:** Table sets itself but has opinions about meal timing (Erasmus).
- **Kitchen:** Largely functional; the pantry reorganizes based on unknown criteria.

**Second Floor:**
- **The Wandering Door:** See below—the manor's most useful and dangerous feature.
- **Bedrooms:** Beds make themselves aggressively (will make themselves while occupied).
- **Library:** Books sorted by a system Erasmus invented. No one else understands it.
- **Study:** Warded, trapped, and full of notes from multiple owners.

**Third Floor:**
- **Guest quarters:** Rarely used. Furniture is dusty but functional.
- **The Observatory:** Telescope that shows "interesting" things. Definition of interesting varies.
- **Storage:** Twenty years of abandoned belongings. Treasure and trash intermixed.

**Basement:**
- **Workshop:** Transmutation circles from multiple eras. Some still active.
- **Wine Cellar:** Some bottles are wine. Some are "experiments." Labels unreliable.
- **The Locked Room:** Erasmus's sanctum. See below.

### The Wandering Door (Second Floor)

The manor's signature magical feature: a door on the second floor landing that connects to whatever room was spoken aloud near it.

**How it works:**
- Say a room name within earshot → the door connects to that room's door
- Works for any room in the house that has a door
- If no room mentioned in the last hour, stays locked
- If the target room has no door, stays locked
- The connection is temporary (a few minutes)

**Uses:**
- Instant navigation (say "kitchen" and step through)
- Escape routes (if you can speak)
- Eavesdropping (connect to a room, listen through crack)

**Problems:**
- Accidental activation (casually mention "the wine cellar" in conversation...)
- Combat complications (enemy says "the armory")
- The Locked Room doesn't respond to its name—something blocks the connection

**Previous owner additions:** Magister Thorn added a "do not disturb" ward to the master bedroom that blocks the door. Lady Ashworth's portraits can speak room names, sometimes mischievously.

### The Locked Room

Erasmus's private sanctum in the basement. No one has opened it since he vanished.

**What's known:**
- Heavy iron door, no visible lock
- The key was never found (or was it locked inside?)
- The Wandering Door won't connect to it
- Previous owners have tried everything to open it
- The Cult of the Closed Eye was very interested in it

**What's suspected:**
- Contains Erasmus's most valuable research
- Contains whatever Erasmus owed debts to
- Contains Erasmus himself (transformed, trapped, or ascended)
- Contains something that shouldn't be let out

**The truth:** Decide when dramatically appropriate. Options:
- Erasmus is inside, frozen in time, waiting for specific conditions
- A bound entity that Erasmus was studying/containing
- A portal to somewhere else
- Nothing—it's a decoy, and the real sanctum is elsewhere
- All of the above, somehow

### Grounds

- **Garden:** Plants "improved" by multiple owners. Results vary wildly.
- **Greenhouse:** More aggressive experiments. The roses bite.
- **Stable:** Empty. A horse left ten years ago. It reportedly talks now and lives near Brackenvale.
- **The Weathervane:** The property's namesake. Spins to point at "danger" but has a very loose definition.

## Notable Objects

Items accumulated over twenty years of owners:

| Object | Origin | What It Does | The Catch |
|--------|--------|--------------|-----------|
| The Armchair | Aldric's "body" | Very comfortable seating | Might contain Aldric's decoy corpse |
| The Ledger of Debts | Erasmus | Records all debts owed to/by the estate | Magically binding, includes Erasmus's debts |
| Speaking Portraits | Lady Ashworth | Comment on events, answer questions | Terrible gossips, sometimes lie |
| Erasmus's Notes | Erasmus | Research on transmutation, house secrets | Handwriting illegible, some pages missing |
| The Observatory Telescope | Unknown | Shows "interesting" celestial events | May show things that aren't in the sky |
| Preserved Experiments | Various | Creatures/objects in stasis jars | Unknown what happens if released |
| Magister Thorn's Wards | Thorn | Protective barriers | Some still active, some corrupted |

## Why No One Keeps It

The estate is desirable (valuable location, magical assets) but no one holds onto it because:

1. **The Ledger of Debts:** Erasmus made deals with entities. Those debts transfer with ownership.
2. **Accumulated curses:** Twenty years of magical accidents, none quite fixed.
3. **The Locked Room:** Something in there wants out. Or wants company.
4. **Legal tangles:** Multiple claims, contradictory wills, disputed inheritance.
5. **The house itself:** It has opinions. It remembers. It plays favorites.

## Using the Manor in Play

### The Estate Sale
Aldric's possessions are being auctioned. Factions compete for items. Players might acquire something valuable, make enemies, or accidentally gain a claim on the estate itself.

### The Inheritance
However it happens, players now own the manor. They quickly discover why no one keeps it. The Ledger of Debts shows what's owed—and to whom. The fun is choosing who to dump the property on.

### The Sentient Cargo
If Aldric (as a crystal) needs transport, he knows recent house secrets but not Erasmus's original ones. His creditors are hunting him.

### The Heist
Someone else owns the manor now. Players need something from inside. The house might remember them—for better or worse.

**Note:** These hooks work in any order. Each one changes the situation but doesn't require the others.
