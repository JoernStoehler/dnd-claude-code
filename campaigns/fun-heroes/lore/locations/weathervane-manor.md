# Weathervane Manor

**Type:** Wizard's estate (recurring location)
**Location:** Just outside Millhaven, on a hill overlooking the Slow River
**Status:** Complicated (changes based on which hook is active)

## Overview

Weathervane Manor was the home and workshop of **Aldric Weathervane**, an eccentric transmutation wizard who died recently under "circumstances." The estate is valuable, problematic, and somehow keeps ending up in the hands of people who weren't expecting it.

The manor is known for:
- Rooms that don't quite stay where you left them
- Objects that are "slightly" cursed (more annoying than dangerous)
- A basement workshop full of half-finished experiments
- A reputation that makes normal buyers... hesitant

## The Late Aldric Weathervane

A transmutation specialist who believed "good enough" was the enemy of "interesting." He never finished most projects, leaving behind a house full of almost-working magical items.

**Personality (as reflected in his creations):**
- Easily distracted, jumped between projects
- Loved elegant solutions to problems no one had
- Believed comfort was more important than safety
- Kept detailed notes in a handwriting no one can read

**How he died:** Officially, "magical accident." Unofficially, no one's quite sure. The body was found transformed into a very nice armchair. It might be reversible. No one's tried.

**His ghost:** May or may not haunt the place. If he does, he's more "distracted academic" than "vengeful spirit"—might help if you can get his attention.

## The Estate Itself

### Main House
Three stories of stone and timber, built sensibly and then modified magically. The architecture *almost* makes sense.

**Ground Floor:**
- **Entry Hall:** Coats hang themselves. Sometimes on people.
- **Great Room:** Self-playing harpsichord (only knows five songs, plays them constantly)
- **Dining Room:** Table sets itself but has opinions about meal timing
- **Kitchen:** Largely functional; the pantry reorganizes based on unknown criteria

**Upper Floors:**
- **Bedrooms:** Beds make themselves aggressively (will make themselves while occupied)
- **Library:** Books are sorted by a system Aldric invented and never explained
- **Study:** Where the good stuff is. Warded, trapped, and full of notes

**Basement:**
- **Workshop:** Transmutation circles, half-finished projects, things in jars
- **Wine Cellar:** Some bottles are wine. Some are "experiments."
- **The Locked Room:** Everyone knows it's there. No one knows what's inside.

### Grounds
- **Garden:** Plants that were "improved." Results vary.
- **Greenhouse:** More advanced experiments. Probably fine.
- **Stable:** Empty. The horse left years ago. Reportedly it talks now.
- **The Weathervane:** The property's namesake. Spins to point at "danger" but has a loose definition of the word.

## Notable Objects

Items that could appear in any of the connected hooks:

| Object | What It Does | The Catch |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| The Armchair (Aldric?) | Very comfortable seating | Might be the wizard's body |
| The Ledger of Debts | Records all debts owed to/by the estate | Magically binding |
| Aldric's Wand | Standard wizard's wand | Only works on Tuesdays |
| The Speaking Portraits | Family portraits that comment on events | Terrible gossips |
| The Cellar Key | Opens the Locked Room | The key is also locked in the room |
| Various "Improved" Objects | Household items with magical additions | All slightly wrong |

## Why It's Problematic

The estate is desirable (valuable location, magical assets) but no one can hold onto it because:

1. **Legal tangles:** Aldric's will is contradictory (possibly intentionally)
2. **Magical complications:** The house "decides" things sometimes
3. **Hidden debts:** The Ledger of Debts records obligations Aldric made with... entities
4. **The Locked Room:** Whatever's in there, it's probably why no one stays long

## Hook Connections

This location supports a multi-part story arc, with the Sentient Cargo hook as a potential bridge:

### The Estate Sale (One-Shot)
Aldric's possessions (not the house itself) are being auctioned. Multiple factions want specific items. Chaos ensues. Players might accidentally trigger something, acquire something, or make enemies.

*Possible consequence:* Players end up with a claim on the estate itself—or acquire a certain crystal...

### The Sentient Cargo (One-Shot, Bridge)
**The Aldric Connection:** One cargo option is Aldric himself. He didn't die—he transferred his consciousness into a crystal to escape his debts. The "armchair body" was a decoy. Now he needs transport to a specific shrine (or back to his own workshop) to complete the process.

- **Useful:** Knows everything about the estate, can teach magic, genuinely brilliant
- **Annoying:** Got himself into this mess, still hasn't learned, makes excuses, wants detours to check on "just one thing"
- **The catch:** If the people he owes discover he's alive, they'll come for the crystal

This creates a situation where players might help Aldric complete his escape, deliver him to his creditors, or use him as leverage.

### The Inheritance (One-Shot)
Players own the manor—briefly. They discover why no one keeps it. The Ledger of Debts shows Aldric owed something to someone. That debt is now theirs (or they have Aldric, and the debt is his).

*Possible consequence:* They have to give up the house to settle the debt, or trade it for something, or lose it to whoever Aldric was running from.

### The Heist (One-Shot)
Someone else owns the manor now—probably Aldric's creditor, or Cousin Morgana who cut a deal with them. But there's still something inside the players need. Time to break in.

*The twist:* The house remembers them from when they owned it. This could help or hinder.

**Possible goals:**
- Retrieve something they left behind
- Get evidence to expose the new owner
- Free something (or someone) trapped in the Locked Room
- Help Aldric (if still involved) reclaim his home
