# Brackenvale

**Type:** Village (adventure-adjacent)
**Population:** ~150
**Vibe:** Remote, slightly nervous, proud of it anyway

## Overview

Brackenvale sits in a shallow valley where the Thornwood Forest meets the lower slopes of the Greypeak Mountains. It's the last settlement before "out there"—the kind of place that produces surprisingly resilient people who are also surprised when anything happens.

The village exists because of three things: timber from the forest, herbs from the mountain slopes, and stubbornness. The road from Millhaven ends here; beyond is trails, not roads.

## Why Adventurers Come Here

- **Proximity to adventure:** Forest has creatures, mountains have caves, the border between them has whatever doesn't fit elsewhere
- **Local problems:** Small village, limited resources, often needs outside help
- **Last stop:** Stock up before heading into the wilds
- **Refuge:** Somewhere to retreat to after the wilds go badly

## Key Locations

### The Fern & Antler (Tavern)
The only tavern, also the inn, also the general store, also where village meetings happen. Run by **Widow Hesta Thornwood**, who inherited it from her husband and runs it better than he ever did. Limited menu, unlimited opinions.

### Elder's House
Home of **Elder Cornelius Marsh**, who's been the village elder for thirty years and intends to remain so until someone pries the title from his cold hands. He thinks Brackenvale is more important than it is, which is both endearing and exhausting.

### The Shrine of the Green Lady
A small outdoor shrine to a local nature spirit. Maintained by **Sage Willowmere**, an elderly herbalist who knows every plant on the mountain slopes and is increasingly hard of hearing.

### The Lumber Yard
Where **Foreman Greta Ironbark** manages the village's main industry. She's practical, no-nonsense, and absolutely will not send her workers into parts of the forest that "feel wrong." She's usually right.

### The Old Watchtower
A crumbling stone tower on a hill overlooking the village. Hasn't been officially manned in decades, but someone's always up there keeping an eye out. Currently **Young Tam**, who takes the duty very seriously despite being fourteen.

## Village Character

**What makes it funny:**
- The elder dramatically overstates every local problem ("This could be the end of Brackenvale as we know it")
- Villagers are simultaneously proud of their remoteness and nervous about it
- Everyone knows everyone's business; gossip travels faster than running
- They have procedures for things that have happened once, decades ago

**What makes it real:**
- These people have to be self-reliant—help is a day's travel away
- They genuinely care about each other (and will tell you what's wrong with you)
- The "forest monsters" and "mountain troubles" are real; they've learned caution honestly

## Common Problems

- Something from the forest is bothering livestock/lumber operations
- Something from the mountains is coming down (creatures, rocks, weather)
- A villager went somewhere they shouldn't and needs rescue
- An old problem the village "solved" years ago is back
- Tensions with the things that live nearby (not all hostile, but not friendly either)

## What's Nearby

### The Thornwood Forest (East)
Dense, old forest. Gets darker and stranger the deeper you go. Home to wildlife, some fey presence, occasional bandits, and things that don't have names. The villagers take what they need from the edges and don't go deep.

### The Greypeak Foothills (North/West)
Rocky slopes rising toward the mountains proper. Known for: medicinal herbs, mine entrances (some abandoned, some not), cave systems, mountain creatures. Clear streams come down from here.

### The Border
Where forest meets mountain slope. Liminal space. Things that don't belong in either place sometimes end up here. The Shrine of the Green Lady marks the safest crossing point.

- Something's in the forest that wasn't there last month

- Young Tam saw something from the watchtower
