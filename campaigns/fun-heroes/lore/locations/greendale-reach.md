# Greendale Reach

**Type:** Region (our sandbox)
**Scope:** A few days' travel across

## Overview

Greendale Reach is the informal name for the area around Millhaven—the town, the surrounding farmland, the villages it services, and the wilder lands at the edges. It's named for the green, rolling farmland that makes up most of the settled area, though it "reaches" into forest and mountain territory at the margins.

This is our primary sandbox: small enough to feel coherent, large enough for variety.

## The Greendale Road

The main artery connecting Millhaven to points east, including Brackenvale. Well-maintained in the central stretch (the town pays for upkeep), gets rougher past the farms.

**Landmarks along the road:**
- **The Waymarker Stone:** Carved milestone about halfway. Meeting point, campsite, occasional impromptu market
- **Haverston Farm:** Last farm before the wilds start. The Haverstons always know what's moving on the road
- **The Three Oaks:** Distinctive cluster of ancient oaks where the farmland ends. Forest begins here

**Travel:**
- Millhaven to Brackenvale: 1 day on foot, half a day on horseback
- The road is safe in the settled stretch, chancier near the forest

|----------|------|-------|
| Millhaven | Market town | Hub, services, adventure guild |
| Scattered farms | Farmland | Mostly peaceful, occasional pest problems |
| Waymarker Stone | Landmark | Midway point, meeting spot |
| Haverston Farm | Farm | Edge of civilization, good for rumors |

## Regional Character

**Tone:** Working countryside. Not idyllic, not grimdark. People have problems, but they're mostly mundane—until they're not.

**Economy:** Grain (Millhaven's mill), timber (Brackenvale), trade passing through (everyone).

**Governance:** Millhaven's Town Council handles the town; Brackenvale handles itself; the farms are technically under some noble who never visits. Problems between settlements get sorted by custom and grudging negotiation.

**Common concerns:**
- Bandits (occasional, not systematic)
- Monster incursions from the wilds (seasonal spikes)
- Trade disputes (constant, low-level)
- Weather (everyone's worried about the harvest)

## Adventure Potential

**Low-stakes (good for new groups):**
- Missing livestock
- Pest control (rats, goblins, angry fey)
- Escort merchants between towns
- Find a missing person (probably got lost, probably fine)

**Medium-stakes:**
- Something's organizing the usual monsters
- A trade caravan was attacked—why this one specifically?
- Old ruins have become active again
- Tensions between settlements need mediation

**High-stakes (escalation):**
- The forest is expanding/moving
- Something from the deep mountains is waking up
- A coordinated threat is targeting the region
- Political pressure from the capital is forcing changes

## What's Beyond

| Direction | What's There | Distance |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| West | More towns, eventually the Capital | Days |
| South | Plains, eventually the Coast | Days |
| North | Mountains proper (dragons, dwarves) | Days to a week |
| East | Deep forest, then ??? | Unknown |

We'll detail these if/when adventures go there.
