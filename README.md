# D&D Campaign Repository

A repository for documenting, planning, and preparing fantasy TTRPG campaigns, using Claude Code agents as AI co-GMs.

## What This Is

This repo stores campaign materials (lore, characters, session logs, encounters) and provides tooling for AI-assisted campaign preparation. Claude Code agents help with tasks like:

- Writing and organizing campaign content
- Designing encounters and NPCs
- Maintaining consistency across campaign materials
- Generating prompts for image creation
- Automating bulk content operations

## For Humans

If you found this repo and want to understand it, the easiest approach is:

1. Clone the repository
2. Open it with Claude Code
3. Ask questions - the AI can navigate and explain the structure

Key files:
- `CLAUDE.md` - Full onboarding documentation (written for AI agents but readable by humans)
- `PROJECT.md` - Current project status and backlog
- `campaigns/` - Individual campaign materials
