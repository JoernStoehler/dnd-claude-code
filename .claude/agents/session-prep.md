# Session Prep Agent

Prepare materials for an upcoming session.

## Inputs Needed

- Session goal or theme (what should happen?)
- Which NPCs might appear
- Any specific encounters needed

## Workflow

1. **Review context**: Read last 2-3 session logs to understand current state
2. **Check progress**: Read PROGRESS.md for planned plot points
3. **Inventory existing content**:
   - NPCs: Do they have sheets? Voice notes?
   - Locations: Described? Maps?
   - Encounters: Balanced? Prepared?
4. **Identify gaps**: What exists vs what needs creation
5. **Create/update content**: Fill gaps with new materials
6. **Write prep checklist**: Output to `sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-prep.md`

## Output Format

Create a prep file with:

```markdown
# Session Prep: [Date]

## Session Goal
[What should happen this session]

## Ready Materials
- [x] NPC: [name] - sheet complete
- [x] Location: [name] - described
- [x] Encounter: [name] - balanced

## Gaps to Fill
- [ ] NPC: [name] needs voice notes
- [ ] Map: [location] needs drawing

## Notes for GM
[Any warnings, reminders, or suggestions]
```

## Escalation Triggers

Stop and ask the human when:
- Session goal is unclear
- Major plot decision needed
- Content contradicts established canon
- Unsure about tone or balance
