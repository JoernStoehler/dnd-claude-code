## Session Prep Checklist

The "Lazy DM" approach - do only what you need.

### Always Do

- [ ] **Strong Start**: Plan an opening scene that pulls players in immediately
  - Action, conflict, or decision - not "you're in a tavern"
- [ ] **Review session notes**: What happened last time? What did you promise?
- [ ] **Check character sheets**: Any level-ups, new abilities, personal goals?

### Usually Helpful

- [ ] **Secrets & Clues**: 3-5 pieces of information players might discover
  - Don't tie them to specific locations - let players find them anywhere
- [ ] **Fantastic Locations**: 2-3 interesting places that might come up
  - One vivid detail per location is enough
- [ ] **NPCs**: Who might players meet? Names at minimum
  - Keep a list of unused names for improvisation
- [ ] **Potential Encounters**: 1-2 combat/social/exploration challenges
  - Don't over-prep - players will surprise you

### When Relevant

- [ ] **Treasure**: What rewards might players find?
- [ ] **Connections to backstories**: Can you weave in character hooks?
- [ ] **Handouts**: Maps, letters, images to show players
- [ ] **Music/ambience**: Playlists ready if you use them

### Technical

- [ ] **Charge devices** (if using digital tools)
- [ ] **Test VTT** (if online)
- [ ] **Print/prepare materials** (if physical)

## Post-Session Checklist

Do within 24 hours while memory is fresh.

### Immediate (same day)

- [ ] **Write session log** - brief summary of what happened
  - What choices did players make?
  - What information was revealed? (now "nailed down")
  - What NPCs did they meet or reference?
- [ ] **Note player reactions** - what excited them? What fell flat?
- [ ] **Record outstanding threads** - promises, hints, unfinished business

### Soon (within a few days)

- [ ] **Update NPC files** if relationships changed
- [ ] **Update location files** if areas were explored/changed
- [ ] **Check for lore contradictions** - did you improvise anything that conflicts?
- [ ] **Delete/update outdated prep** - don't keep wrong information around
- [ ] **Acknowledge player feedback** if any was given

### Before Next Session

- [ ] **Send recap** to players (optional but appreciated)
- [ ] **Prompt for between-session actions** if your campaign supports downtime

## New Campaign Startup Checklist

Before running Session Zero.

### Preparation

- [ ] Write campaign concept (1-2 paragraphs)
- [ ] Decide on rules system and any house rules
- [ ] Prepare Session Zero materials
- [ ] Create initial world/setting notes (just enough to start)
- [ ] Prepare first adventure hook

### Repository Setup (for this workflow)

- [ ] Create campaign directory: `campaigns/<campaign-name>/`
- [ ] Write campaign CLAUDE.md with setting context
- [ ] Set up initial folders: `lore/`, `characters/`, `sessions/`, `encounters/`
- [ ] Create template files or link to shared templates

### Player Communication

- [ ] Invite players with campaign pitch
- [ ] Share character creation guidelines
- [ ] Schedule Session Zero

## Campaign Health Check

Run periodically (every 5-10 sessions) or when things feel off.

### Player Engagement

- [ ] Is everyone getting spotlight time?
- [ ] Are backstory threads being addressed?
- [ ] Does combat/roleplay/exploration balance feel right for the group?
- [ ] Any players seeming disengaged?

### Pacing

- [ ] Is the plot advancing at a satisfying rate?
- [ ] Are there too many/too few open threads?
- [ ] Does the group know what their current goal is?

### Logistics

- [ ] Is the schedule still working for everyone?
- [ ] Any recurring friction points to address?
- [ ] Do safety tools need refreshing?

### Documentation

- [ ] Are session logs up to date?
- [ ] Is lore documentation accurate?
- [ ] Any outdated information that should be deleted?

## Quick Reference: Safety Tools

### X-Card
Place a card with "X" on the table. Tapping it means "I'm not comfortable with this - please change the scene." No explanation required.

### Lines & Veils
- **Line**: This content does not exist in our game at all
- **Veil**: This content exists but happens off-screen / in vague terms

Common Lines: graphic torture, sexual assault, harm to children, real-world prejudice
Common Veils: romance, intimate scenes, detailed gore

### "Pause for a Minute"
A verbal X-Card. When anyone says this phrase, gameplay stops immediately to check in.

### Open Door Policy
Anyone can leave the table at any time, no questions asked. They're welcome back when ready.
