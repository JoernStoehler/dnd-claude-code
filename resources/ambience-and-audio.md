# Ambience and Audio for Sessions

Curated audio resources for tabletop sessions. The goal is "set and forget" background audio that enhances atmosphere without demanding attention.

## Quick Start

If you just want something playing and don't want to research:

1. Go to **Tabletop Audio** (tabletopaudio.com)
2. Pick a track matching your scene (tavern, forest, dungeon, etc.)
3. Set volume LOW (should be barely noticeable)
4. Done.

## Implementation Tips

### Before Session
1. Pick 3-5 tracks/playlists covering expected scenes
2. Test audio output (speakers, volume levels)
3. Have tabs/apps open and ready
4. Know how to quickly mute if needed

### During Session
- Start audio during scene transitions, not mid-conversation
- Keep volume where it's "ignorable" - if players notice it consciously, it's too loud
- Don't stress about perfect matches - close enough works
- Mute during complex rules discussions

### What to Avoid
- Tracks with sudden loud moments
- Recognizable songs (players will comment/sing along)
- Lyrics in languages players understand
- Changing tracks constantly (distracting)
- Making it a big deal - it's background, not the show

## Why NOT to Generate Custom Audio

**Current state of AI audio:**
- Ambient soundscape generation is mediocre
- Music generation is improving but inconsistent
- Quality assurance requires human listening to entire tracks
- No good automation for "does this sound creepy enough?"

**Better alternatives exist:**
- Thousands of hours of free human-made content
- Purpose-built by people who understand TTRPG needs
- Already curated and organized

**Recommendation:** Use existing content. Time spent generating/curating custom audio has poor ROI compared to other prep activities.
